\emph{Just play that on repeat all the way through the song except for the bridge}

\textbf{Verse 1}

Hip-hip x4

When you're on a holiday, You can't find the words to say

All the things that come to you, And I wanna feel it too

\textbf{Chorus}
On an island in the sun, We'll be playing and having fun

And it makes me feel so fine, I can't control my brain

\textbf{Verse 2}

Hip-hip x2

When you're on a golden sea, You don't need no memory

Just a place to call your own, As we drift into the zone

\textbf{Repeat Chorus}

\textbf{Bridge}

\upchord{D}We'll run a\upchord{G}way together, \upchord{D}We'll spend some \upchord{G}time forever

\upchord{C}We'll never \upchord{A}feel bad any \upchord{D}more

Hip-hip x3

\textbf{Repeat Chorus}

\textbf{Verse 4 and Outro}

We'll run away together, We'll spend some time forever

We'll never feel bad anymore

Hip-hip

(Hip-hip) we'll never feel bad anymore

Hip-hip No, no (hip-hip)

(Hip-hip) we'll never feel bad anymore (Hip-hip)

No, no (hip-hip), No, no (hip-hip)
