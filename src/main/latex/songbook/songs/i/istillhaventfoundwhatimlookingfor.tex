I have  \upchord{C}  climbed the highest mountains, I have run through the fields\\
only to \upchord{Csus4} be with you, only to \upchord{C} be with you\\
\upchord{C} I have run, I have crawled\\
I have scaled these city walls, these city \upchord{Csus4} walls\\
only to \upchord{C} be with you\\
But I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what I'm \upchord{C} looking for\\
But I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what I'm \upchord{C} looking for \upchord{Csus4} \upchord{C}\\
I have \upchord{C} kissed honey lips, felt the healing in her fingertips\\
It burned like \upchord{Csus4} fire, this burning des\upchord{C}ire\\
\upchord{C} I have spoke with the tongue of angels\\
\upchord{C} I have held the hand of a devil\\
it was warm in the \upchord{Csus4} night, I was cold as a \upchord{C} stone\\
But I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what I'm \upchord{C} looking for\\
But I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what I'm \upchord{C} looking for \upchord{Csus4} \upchord{C}\\
But I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what I'm \upchord{C} looking for\\
But I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what I'm \upchord{C} looking for \upchord{Csus4} \upchord{C}\\
I be\upchord{C}lieve in the kingdom come\\
Then all the colours they will bleed into one, bleed into \upchord{Csus4} one\\
But yes i'm still \upchord{C} running\\
You broke the \upchord{C} bonds and you loosed the chains\\
Carried the cross of, of my shame, of my \upchord{Csus4} shame\\
you know I be\upchord{C}lieve it\\
but I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what i'm \upchord{C} looking for\\
but I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what i'm \upchord{C} looking for\\
but I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what i'm \upchord{C} looking for\\
but I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what i'm \upchord{C} looking for\\
but I \upchord{G} still haven't \upchord{Csus4} found what i'm \upchord{C} looking for\\
