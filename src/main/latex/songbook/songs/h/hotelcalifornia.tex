\upchord{Am} On a dark desert highway \upchord{E7} cool wind in my hair\\
\upchord{G} Warm smell of colitas \upchord{D} rising up through the air\\
\upchord{F} Up ahead in the distance \upchord{C} I saw a shimmering light\\
\upchord{Dm} My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim\\
\upchord{E7} I had to stop for the night\\
\upchord{Am} There she stood in the doorway \upchord{E7} I heard the mission bell\\
\upchord{G} And I was thinking to myself this could be \upchord{D} heaven or this could be hell\\
\upchord{F} Then she lit up a candle \upchord{C} and she showed me the way\\
\upchord{Dm} There were voices down the corridor \upchord{E7} I thought I heard them say\\
\upchord{F} Welcome to the Hotel Cali\upchord{C}fornia\\
Such a \upchord{Dm} lovely place such a \upchord{Am} lovely face\\
\upchord{F} Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali\upchord{C}fornia\\
Any \upchord{Dm} time of year you can \upchord{E7} find it here\\
\upchord{Am} Her mind is Tiffany twisted \upchord{E7} she got the Mercedes bends\\
\upchord{G} She got a lot of pretty pretty boys \upchord{D} that she calls friends\\
\upchord{F} How they dance in the courtyard \upchord{C} sweet summer sweat\\
\upchord{Dm} Some dance to remember \upchord{E7} some dance to forget\\
\upchord{Am} So I called up the captain \upchord{E7} please bring me my wine\\
He said \upchord{G} we haven't had that spirit here since \upchord{D} 1969\\
\upchord{F} And still those voices are calling from \upchord{C} far away\\
\upchord{Dm} Wake you up in the middle of the night \upchord{E7} just to hear them say\\
\upchord{F} Welcome to the Hotel Cali\upchord{C}fornia\\
Such a \upchord{Dm} lovely place such a \upchord{Am} lovely face\\
\upchord{F} Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali\upchord{C}fornia\\
Any \upchord{Dm} time of year you can \upchord{E7} find it here\\
\upchord{Am} Mirrors on the ceiling \upchord{E7} the pink champagne on ice\\
And she said \upchord{G} we are all just prisoners here \upchord{D} of our own device\\
\upchord{F} And in the master's chambers \upchord{C} they gathered for the feast\\
\upchord{Dm} They stab it with their steely knives but they \upchord{E7} just can't kill the beast\\
\upchord{Am} Last thing I remember I was \upchord{E7} running for the door\\
\upchord{G} I had to find the passage back to the \upchord{D} place I was before\\
\upchord{F} Relax said the nightman we are \upchord{C} programmed to receive\\
\upchord{Dm} You can check out anytime you like \upchord{E7} but you can never leave\\
\upchord{F} Welcome to the Hotel Cali\upchord{C}fornia\\
Such a \upchord{Dm} lovely place such a \upchord{Am} lovely face\\
They \upchord{F} livin' it up at the Hotel Cali\upchord{C}fornia\\
What a \upchord{Dm} nice surprise bring your \upchord{E7} alibis \upchord{Am}
