\upchord{Am} Hey kids, \upchord{D} shake it loose together\\
The \upchord{G} spotlight's hitting something\\
That's been \upchord{Em} known to change the weather\\
\upchord{Am} We'll kill the fatted \upchord{D} calf tonight\\
So stick a-\upchord{Em}round you're \upchord{Am} gonna hear electric \upchord{Bm} music\\
Solid walls of \upchord{C} sound\\
Say, \upchord{Gmaj7} Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet\\
\upchord{Am7} But they're so spaced out, \upchord{C7} Bennie and the \upchord{C} Jets\\
\upchord{Gmaj7} Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful\\
Oh, \upchord{Am} Bennie she's really keen\\
She's got e-\upchord{C}lectric boots, a \upchord{D} mohair suit\\
You know I \upchord{Em} read it in a maga-\upchord{G}zine oh, \upchord{C} ho\\
\upchord{C} B-B-B-Bennie and the \upchord{Gmaj7} Jets \upchord{G} Fmaj7}\\
\upchord{Am} Hey kids, \upchord{D} plug into the faithless\\
\upchord{G} Maybe they're blinded\\
But \upchord{Em} Bennie makes them ageless\\
\upchord{Am7} We shall sur-\upchord{D}vive, let us take ourselves a-\upchord{Em}long\\
Where we \upchord{Am7} fight our parents out in the \upchord{Bm7} streets\\
To find who's right and who's \upchord{C} wrong\\
Say, \upchord{Gmaj7} Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet\\
\upchord{Am7} But they're so spaced out, \upchord{C7} Bennie and the \upchord{C} Jets\\
\upchord{Gmaj7} Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful\\
Oh, \upchord{Am} Bennie she's really keen\\
She's got e-\upchord{C}lectric boots, a \upchord{D} mohair suit\\
You know I \upchord{Em} read it in a  maga-\upchord{G}zine oh, \upchord{C} ho\\
\upchord{C} B-B-B-Bennie and the \upchord{Gmaj7} Jets \upchord{G} \upchord{Fmaj7}\\
Say, \upchord{Gmaj7} Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet\\
\upchord{Am7} But they're so spaced out, \upchord{C7} Bennie and the \upchord{C} Jets\\
\upchord{Gmaj7} Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful\\
Oh, \upchord{Am} Bennie she's really keen\\
She's got e-\upchord{C}lectric boots, a \upchord{D} mohair suit\\
You know I \upchord{Em} read it in a maga-\upchord{G}zine oh, \upchord{C} ho\\
\upchord{C} B-B-B-Bennie and the \upchord{Gmaj7} Jets \upchord{G} \upchord{Fmaj7}\\
\upchord{G} Bennie,Bennie \upchord{G} \upchord{Fmaj7} yeah   (repeat and fade out)
