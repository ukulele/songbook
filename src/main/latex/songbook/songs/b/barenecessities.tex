\textbf{intro} \upchord{G}\\
Look for the... \upchord{G} bare ne\upchord{G7}cessities\\
the \upchord{C}simple bare ne\upchord{C7}cessities\\
For\upchord{G}get about your \upchord{E7}worries and your \upchord{A7}strife \upchord{D7}\\
I mean the... \upchord{G} bare ne\upchord{G7}cessities…
old \upchord{C}Mother Nature's \upchord{C7}recipes\\
That \upchord{G}brings the \upchord{E7}bare ne\upchord{A7}cess\upchord{D7}ities of \upchord{G}life\\
Wherever I \upchord{D7}wander… wherever I \upchord{G}roam\\
I couldn't be \upchord{D7}fonder... of my big \upchord{G}home \upchord{G7}\\
The bees are \upchord{C}buzzin' in the \upchord{Cm}tree\\
to make some \upchord{G}honey just for \upchord{A7}me\\
When \upchord{A7}you look under the rocks and plants\\
and \upchord{D7}take a glance at the fancy ants, then\\
\upchord{G}Maybe… try a \upchord{E7}few… the bare ne\upchord{A7}cessities of\\
\upchord{D7}Life will come to \upchord{G}you…they’ll \upchord{D7}come to \upchord{G}you\\

I mean the... \upchord{G} bare ne\upchord{G7}cessities\\
That's \upchord{C}why a bear can \upchord{C7}rest at ease\\
With \upchord{G}just the \upchord{E7}bare ne\upchord{A7}cess\upchord{D7}ities of \upchord{G}life\\
When you pick a \upchord{D7}pawpaw… or a prickly \upchord{G}pear\\
And you prick a \upchord{D7}raw paw… next time be\upchord{G}ware \upchord{G7}\\
Don't pick the \upchord{C}prickly pear by the \upchord{Cm}paw\\
when you pick a \upchord{G}pear, try to use the \upchord{A7}claw\\
But \upchord{A7}you don't need to use the claw\\
when \upchord{D7}you pick a pear of the big pawpaw\\
\upchord{G}Have I given you a \upchord{E7}clue?\\
The bare ne\upchord{A7}cessities of \upchord{D7}Life will come to \upchord{G}you\\
