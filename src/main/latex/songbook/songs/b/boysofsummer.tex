\textbf{Intro} \upchord{Am} \upchord{F} \upchord{G} \upchord{F} x 2 with optional riff over A3 A2 E3

\upchord{Am} Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach

\upchord{F} I feel it in the air summer’s out of reach

\upchord{G} Empty lake empty streets the sun goes down alone

\upchord{F} I’m driving by your house though I know you’re not home

\textbf{Chorus}

\upchord{C} I can see you \upchord{G} your brown skin shining in the sun

You got your hair combed back and \upchord{F} sunglasses on

\upchord{C} I can tell you my \upchord{G} love for you will still be strong 

After the boys of \upchord{F} summer have gone

\textbf{Repeat intro}

\upchord{Am} I never will forget those nights I think it was a dream

\upchord{F} The way you made me crazy the way I made you scream

\upchord{G} I don’t understand what happened to our love \upchord{F}

Babe I’m gonna get you back gonna show you what I’m made of

\upchord{C} I can see you \upchord{G} your brown skin shining in the sun

I see you walking real slow and \upchord{F} smiling at everyone

\upchord{C} I can tell you my \upchord{G} love for you will still be strong

After the boys of \upchord{F} summer have gone

\textbf{Repeat intro}

\upchord{Am} Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac

\upchord{F} Little voice inside my head

Saying don’t look back you can never look back

\upchord{G} I thought I knew what love was what did I know

\upchord{F} Those days are gone forever I should just let ‘em go 

\upchord{C} I can see you \upchord{G} your brown skin shining in the sun

You got your top pulled down and \upchord{F} radio on

\upchord{C} I can tell you my \upchord{G} love for you will still be strong

After the boys of \upchord{F} summer have gone

\upchord{C} I can see you \upchord{G} your brown skin shining in the sun

You got your hair combed back and \upchord{F} Wayfarers on, baby

\upchord{C} I can tell you my \upchord{G} love for you will still be strong

After the boys of \upchord{F} summer have gone

\textbf{Repeat intro} \upchord{Am}
