\textbf{Intro:} \upchord{C} \upchord{G} \upchord{C} \upchord{G} \upchord{F} \upchord{G} \\
\upchord{C} It's up in the morn\upchord{G}-ing its on the downs \upchord{C}\\
Little white \upchord{G} clouds like a-gambolling \upchord{F} lambs\\
And I am breath\upchord{G}-less over you \upchord{C}\\
And the red-breasted \upchord{G} robin beats his \upchord{C} wings\\
His throat it \upchord{G} trembles when he sings \upchord{F}\\
For he is \upchord{G} helpless before \upchord{C} you\\
The happy hooded \upchord{G} bluebells bow\\
And \upchord{C} bend their \upchord{G} heads all a-down \upchord{F}\\
Heavied \upchord{G} by the early morning dew \upchord{C}\\
At the whispering \upchord{G} stream, at the bubbling \upchord{C} brook\\
The fishes leap \upchord{G} up to take a \upchord{F} look\\
For they are \upchord{G} breathless over \upchord{C} you\\
Still your \upchord{G} hands, and still your \upchord{C} heart\\
For still your \upchord{G} face comes shining \upchord{F} through\\
And all the \upchord{G} morning glows a\upchord{C}-new\\
Still your \upchord{G} mind, and still your \upchord{C} soul\\
For still the \upchord{G} fire of love is \upchord{F} true\\
And I am \upchord{G} breathless without \upchord{C} you\\
\upchord{F} / \upchord{G} / \upchord{C} / / / \upchord{F} / \upchord{G} \\
\upchord{C} The wind circles a\upchord{G}-mong the trees\\
And it \upchord{C} bangs about the \upchord{G} new-made leaves \upchord{F}\\
For it is \upchord{G} breathless without \upchord{C} you\\
And the fox chases the \upchord{G} rabbit round\\
And the \upchord{C} rabbit hides be\upchord{G}-neath the ground \upchord{F}\\
For he is \upchord{G} defenceless without \upchord{C} you\\
The sky of daytime \upchord{G} dies away\\
And \upchord{C} all the earthly things \upchord{G} they stop to play \upchord{F}\\
For we are \upchord{G} all breathless without \upchord{C} you\\
I listen to my \upchord{G} juddering bones\\
And the \upchord{C} blood in my veins and the \upchord{G} wind in my lungs \upchord{F}\\
And I am \upchord{G} breathless without \upchord{C} you\\
Still your \upchord{G} hands, and still your \upchord{C} heart\\
For still your \upchord{G} face comes shining \upchord{F} through\\
And all the \upchord{G} morning glows a\upchord{C}-new\\
Still your \upchord{G} soul, and still your \upchord{C} mind\\
For still the \upchord{G} fire of love is \upchord{F} true\\
And I am \upchord{G} breathless without \upchord{F} you \upchord{C}
