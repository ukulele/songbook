\textbf{Verse 1:}

\upchord{A} Mama Pajama rolled out of bed

And she ran to the police \upchord{D}station

When the \upchord{E}papa found out he began to shout

And he started the investig\upchord{A}ation \upchord{D}\upchord{A}

\textbf{Chorus:}

It's against the \upchord{E}law

It was against the \upchord{A}law

What the mama \upchord{E}saw, it was against the \upchord{A}law\upchord{D}\upchord{A}\upchord{E}

\textbf{Verse 2:}

\upchord{A} Mama looked down and spit on the ground

Every time my name gets \upchord{D}mentioned

\upchord{E}Papa said "Oi if I get that boy

I'm gonna stick him in the house of \upchord{A}detention"\upchord{D}\upchord{A}\upchord{E}


\textbf{Chorus 2:}

I'm on my \upchord{D}way

I don't know \upchord{A}where I'm going

I'm on my \upchord{D}way

I'm taking my \upchord{A}time but I \upchord{B7}don't know \upchord{E}where

Goodbye to \upchord{D}Rosie, the queen of Cor\upchord{A}ona

\textbf{Verse 3:}

In a \upchord{A}couple of days they come and take me away 

But the press let the story \upchord{D}leak
