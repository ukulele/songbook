\upchord{A} \upchord{Dm} \upchord{F} \upchord{Dm}\\
We passed upon the \upchord{A7}stair\\
We spoke of was and when \upchord{Dm}\\
Although I wasn't \upchord{A7}there \\
He said I was his friend \upchord{F}\\
Which came as some sur\upchord{C}prise \\
I spoke into his \upchord{A}eyes, I thought you died a\upchord{Dm}lone\\
A long, long time a\upchord{C scale}go\\
Oh \upchord{C scale}no not \upchord{F scale}me\\
I \upchord{D scale}never lost con\upchord{F scale}trol\\
You're \upchord{C scale}face to \upchord{F scale}face\\
With the \upchord{D riff}man who sold the world\\
\upchord{A} \upchord{Dm} \upchord{F} \upchord{Dm}\\
I laughed and shook his \upchord{A7}hand\\
And made my way back \upchord{Dm}home\\
I searched for form and \upchord{A7}land\\
For years and years I roa\upchord{F}med\\
I gazed a gazely \upchord{C}stare\\
At all the millions \upchord{A}here, we must have died a\upchord{Dm}lone\\
A long, long time a\upchord{C}go\\
Who \upchord{C scale}knows? Not me\upchord{F scale}\\
We \upchord{D scale}never lost con\upchord{F scale}trol\\
You're \upchord{C scale}face to \upchord{F scale}face\\
With the \upchord{D riff}man who sold the world\\
