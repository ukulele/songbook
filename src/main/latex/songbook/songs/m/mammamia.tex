\upchord{C} I've been \upchord{G} cheated by \upchord{C} you since I \upchord{G} don't know \upchord{F} when\\
\upchord{C} So I \upchord{G} made up my \upchord{C} mind, it must \upchord{G} come to an \upchord{F} end\\
\upchord{C} Look at me now, \upchord{Caug} will I ever learn?\\
\upchord{C} I don't know how \upchord{Caug} but I suddenly \upchord{F} lose control\\
There's a fire with- \upchord{G7} in my soul\\
\upchord{F} Just \upchord{C} one \upchord{G} look and I can hear a bell ring\\
\upchord{F} One \upchord{C} more \upchord{G} look and I forget everything, ooh\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, here I go again\\
\upchord{Bb} My \upchord{F} my, how can I re- \upchord{C} sist you?\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, does it show again?\\
\upchord{Bb} My \upchord{F} my, just how much I've \upchord{C} missed you\\
Yes, I've been \upchord{G} broken-hearted,  \upchord{Am} Blue since the \upchord{Em} day we parted\\
\upchord{Bb} Why, \upchord{F} why \upchord{Dm} did I ever \upchord{G7} let you go?\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, \upchord{Am} now I really know,\\
\upchord{Bb} My \upchord{F} my, \upchord{Dm} I could never \upchord{G7} let you go\\
\upchord{C} \upchord{Caug} \upchord{C} \upchord{Caug}\\
\upchord{C} I've been \upchord{G} angry and \upchord{C} sad about the \upchord{G} things that you \upchord{F} do\\
\upchord{C} I can't \upchord{G} count all the \upchord{C} times that I've\\
\upchord{G} Told you we're \upchord{F} through\\
\upchord{C} And when you go, \upchord{Caug} when you slam the door\\
\upchord{C} I think you know \upchord{Caug} that you won't be a- \upchord{F} way too long\\
You know that I'm \upchord{G7} not that strong\\
\upchord{F} Just \upchord{C} one \upchord{G} look and I can hear a bell ring\\
\upchord{F} One \upchord{C} more \upchord{G} look and I forget everything, ooh\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, here I go again\\
\upchord{Bb} My \upchord{F} my, how can I re- \upchord{C} sist you?\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, does it show again?\\
\upchord{Bb} My \upchord{F} my, just how much I've \upchord{C} missed you\\
Yes, I've been \upchord{G} broken-hearted,  \upchord{Am} Blue since the \upchord{Em} day we parted\\
\upchord{Bb} Why, \upchord{F} why \upchord{Dm} did I ever \upchord{G7} let you go?\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, \upchord{Am} even if I say\\
\upchord{Bb} Bye \upchord{F} bye, \upchord{Dm} leave me now or \upchord{G} never\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, \upchord{Am} it's a game we play\\
\upchord{Bb} Bye \upchord{F} bye \upchord{Dm} doesn't mean for- \upchord{G} ever\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, here I go again\\
\upchord{Bb} My \upchord{F} my, how can I re- \upchord{C} sist you?\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, does it show again?\\
\upchord{Bb} My \upchord{F} my, just how much I've \upchord{C} missed you\\
Yes, I've been \upchord{G} broken-hearted,  \upchord{Am} Blue since the \upchord{Em} day we parted\\
\upchord{Bb} Why, \upchord{F} why \upchord{Dm} did I ever \upchord{G7} let you go?\\
\upchord{C} Mamma mia, \upchord{Am} now I really know,\\
\upchord{Bb} My \upchord{F} my, \upchord{Dm} I could never \upchord{G7} let you go \upchord{C} \upchord{Caug} \upchord{C} \upchord{Caug} \upchord{C}
