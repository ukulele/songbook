\upchord{D} A singer in a \upchord{A}smoky room \upchord{Bm} A smell of wine and \upchord{G}cheap perfume

\upchord{D} For a smile they can \upchord{A}share the night, it goes \upchord{F\#m}on and on and \upchord{G}on and on

\upchord{G}Strangers... waiting... \upchord{D} up and down the boulevard

Their \upchord{G}shadows... searching in the \upchord{D}night
