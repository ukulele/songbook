\textbf{intro} \upchord{G}

Oh I could \upchord{G}hide… ‘neath the \upchord{Am}wings

Of the \upchord{Bm}bluebird as she \upchord{C}sings

The \upchord{G}six o’ clock a\upchord{Em7}larm

Would never \upchord{A7}ring \upchord{D7}

But it \upchord{G}rings… and I \upchord{Am}rise

Wipe the \upchord{Bm}sleep out of my \upchord{C}eyes

My \upchord{G}shaving \upchord{Em7}razor’s \upchord{Am}cold \upchord{D}and it
\upchord{G}Stings

\upchord{C}Cheer up sleepy \upchord{Bm}Jean

\upchord{C}Oh what can it \upchord{Em}mean to a

\upchord{G} Daydream be\upchord{C}liever and a

\upchord{G} Homecoming \upchord{A7}queen

\upchord{G}You once thought of \upchord{Am}me

As a \upchord{Bm}white knight on his \upchord{C}steed

\upchord{G}Now you know how \upchord{Em7}happy

I can \upchord{A7}be \upchord{D7}

Whoa and our \upchord{G}good times start and \upchord{Am}end

Without \upchord{Bm}dollar one to \upchord{C}spend

But \upchord{G}how much baby \upchord{Am}do we really \upchord{G}need

\upchord{C}Cheer up sleepy \upchord{Bm}Jean

\upchord{C}Oh what can it \upchord{Em}mean to a

\upchord{G} Daydream be\upchord{C}liever and a

\upchord{G} Homecoming \upchord{A7}queen 

\upchord{C}Cheer up sleepy \upchord{Bm}Jean

\upchord{C}Oh what can it \upchord{Em}mean to a

\upchord{G} Daydream be\upchord{C}liever and a

\upchord{G} Homecoming \upchord{A7}queen \upchord{D7}

\upchord{G} – single strum
