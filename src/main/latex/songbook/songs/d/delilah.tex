\textbf{Intro} \upchord{Em}

\upchord{Em}I saw the light on the night that I passed by her \upchord{B7}window

\upchord{Em}I saw the flickering shadows of love on her \upchord{B7}blind

\upchord{E}She... \upchord{E7}was... my \upchord{Am}woman

\upchord{Em}As she deceived me, I \upchord{B7}watched and went out of my \upchord{Em}mind

\upchord{D7}

My my \upchord{G}my... De\upchord{D7}lilah

Why why \upchord{D7}why... De\upchord{G}lilah?

\upchord{G}I... could \upchord{G7}see... that \upchord{C}girl was no good for \upchord{A7}me

\upchord{G}But I was lost like a \upchord{D7}slave... that no man could \upchord{G}free \upchord{B7}

\upchord{Em}At break of day when that man drove away I was \upchord{B7}waiting

\upchord{Em}I crossed the street to her house and she opened the \upchord{B7}door

\upchord{E}She... \upchord{E7}stood... there \upchord{Am}laughing

Then \upchord{Em}I felt the knife in my \upchord{B7}hand and she laughed no \upchord{Em}more

\upchord{D7}

My my \upchord{G}my... De\upchord{D7}lilah

Why why \upchord{D7}why... De\upchord{G}lilah?

\upchord{G}So be\upchord{G7}fore... they \upchord{C}come to break down the \upchord{Am}door

For\upchord{G}give me Delilah I \upchord{D7}just couldn’t take any \upchord{G}more \upchord{B7}

\upchord{Em} \upchord{B7} \upchord{Em} \upchord{B7}

\upchord{E}She... \upchord{E7}stood... there \upchord{Am}laughing

Then \upchord{Em}I felt the knife in my \upchord{B7}hand and she laughed no \upchord{Em}more

\upchord{D7}

My my \upchord{G}my... De\upchord{D7}lilah

Why why \upchord{D7}why... De\upchord{G}lilah?

\upchord{G}So be\upchord{G7}fore... they \upchord{C}come to break down the \upchord{Am}door

For\upchord{G}give me Delilah I \upchord{D7}just couldn’t take any \upchord{G}more

For\upchord{Em}give me Delilah I \upchord{B7}just couldn’t take any \upchord{Em}more \upchord{B7}

\upchord{Em}
