VERSE 1\\
\upchord{C} Slip inside the \upchord{G} eye of your \upchord{Am} mind\\
Don't you \upchord{E7} know you might \upchord{F} find \upchord{G}\\
A better place to \upchord{C} play  \upchord{Am} \upchord{G}\\
\upchord{C} You said that \upchord{G} you'd never \upchord{Am} been\\
But all the \upchord{E7} things that you've \upchord{F} seen \upchord{G}\\
Slowly fade a-\upchord{C}way  \upchord{Am} \upchord{G} \upchord{F}\\
BRIDGE\\
\upchord{F} So I start a revo-\upchord{Fm}lution from my \upchord{C} bed\\
'Cos you \upchord{F} said the brains I \upchord{Fm} had went to my \upchord{C} head\\
\upchord{F} Step outside, the \upchord{Fm} summertime's in \upchord{C} bloom\\
\upchord{G} Stand up beside the fireplace\\
\upchord{E7} Take that look from off your face\\
'Cos \upchord{Am} you ain't ever \upchord{G} gonna burn my \upchord{F} heart out \upchord{G}\\
CHORUS\\
\upchord{C} So \upchord{G} Sally can \upchord{Am} wait, she \upchord{E7} knows it's too \upchord{F} late\\
as she's \upchord{G} walking on \upchord{C} by  \upchord{Am} \upchord{G}\\
Her \upchord{C} soul \upchord{G} slides a-\upchord{Am}way, \upchord{E7}\\
but don't look \upchord{F} back in anger \upchord{G}\\
I heard you \upchord{C} say  \upchord{G} \upchord{Am}  \upchord{E7}  \upchord{F} \upchord{G} \upchord{C}  \upchord{Am} \upchord{G}\\
VERSE 2\\
\upchord{C} Take me to the \upchord{G} place where you \upchord{Am} go\\
Where \upchord{E7} nobody \upchord{F} knows, \upchord{G} if it's night or \upchord{C} day  \upchord{Am} \upchord{G}\\
\upchord{C} Please don't put your \upchord{G} life in the \upchord{Am} hands\\
of a \upchord{E7} rock and roll \upchord{F} band, \upchord{G} who'll throw it all a-\upchord{C}way  \upchord{Am} \upchord{G}\\

\upchord{C} Her soul \upchord{G} slides a-\upchord{Am}way\\
But don't look \upchord{F} back in anger\\
Don't look \upchord{Fm} back in anger\\
I heard you \upchord{C} say  \upchord{G} \upchord{Am}  \upchord{E7} \upchord{F} \upchord{Fm} least not to-\upchord{C}day\\
