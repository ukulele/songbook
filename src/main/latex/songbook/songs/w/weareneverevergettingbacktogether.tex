\upchord{C} I remember when we broke \upchord{G} up the first time\\
\upchord{D} Saying, "This is it, I've had \upchord{Em7} enough," 'cause like\\
\upchord{C} We hadn't seen each other in a \upchord{G} month\\
When you \upchord{D} said you needed \upchord{Em7} space. What?\\
 \\
\upchord{C} Then you come around again and \upchord{G} say\\
"Baby, I \upchord{D} miss you and I swear I'm gonna \upchord{Em7} change\\
Trust me, \upchord{C} remember how that lasted for a \upchord{G} day"\\
I say, "I \upchord{D} hate you, we break up," you \upchord{Em7} call me, "I love you".\\
 \\
\upchord{C} Oooh \upchord{G} oh …we \upchord{D} called it off \upchord{Em7} again last night\\
But \upchord{C} oooh \upchord{G} oh …, this \upchord{D} time I'm \upchord{Em7} telling you, I'm telling you.\\
 \\
\textbf{Chorus} \upchord{C} We are \upchord{G} never ever \upchord{D} ever getting\upchord{Em7} back to-\upchord{D} gether\\
\upchord{C} We are \upchord{G} never ever \upchord{D} ever getting \upchord{Em7} back to-\upchord{D} gether\\
\upchord{C} You go talk to \upchord{G} your friends, talk to my \upchord{D} friends, talk to \upchord{Em7} me \upchord{D}\\
But \upchord{C} we are \upchord{G} never ever \upchord{D} ever ever \upchord{Em7} getting back to-\upchord{C} gether, \upchord{G} like \upchord{D} ever...\upchord{Em7}\\
\\
I'm \upchord{C} really gonna miss you picking \upchord{G} fights\\
And me, \upchord{D} falling for it screaming that I'm \upchord{Em7} right\\
And you, \upchord{C} would hide away and find your piece of \upchord{G} mind\\
With some \upchord{D} indie record that's much \upchord{Em7} cooler than mine.\\
 \\
\upchord{C} Oooh \upchord{G} oh …we \upchord{D} called it off \upchord{Em7} again last night\\
But \upchord{C} oooh \upchord{G} oh …, this \upchord{D} time I'm \upchord{Em7} telling you, I'm telling you.\\
 \\
\textbf{Repeat Chorus}\\
\textbf{Bridge} \upchord{C} I used to \upchord{G} think that \upchord{D} we were for-\upchord{Em7} ever ever ever\\
And \upchord{C} I used to \upchord{G} say \upchord{D} never say \upchord{Em7} never\\
\upchord{C} Huh, so he \upchord{G} calls me up and he's like, "I still \upchord{D} love you"\\
And I'm \upchord{Em7} like, "I just, I mean \upchord{C} this is exhausting, you \upchord{G} know\\
We are never getting \upchord{D} back together, like ever".\\
\textbf{Repeat Chorus x 2}  \\
