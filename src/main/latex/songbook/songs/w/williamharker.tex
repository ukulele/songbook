  Me \upchord{G} name is William Harker I'm a rake and a roarin' blade
  \upchord{C} Revelry is \upchord{G} my delight and \upchord{Am} roguery's me \upchord{D} trade
  If you \upchord{G} chuck a penny in the ole grey goose you're sure to hit a nail
  \upchord{C} There's no one that \upchord{G} I have done, no \upchord{Am} friendship \upchord{D} I've be\upchord{G}trayed
  CHORUS
  And it's \upchord{G} hold me hand me hearties, step with the heel and toe
  \upchord{C} Rolling down, \upchord{G} strolling down to the \upchord{Am} public house we'll \upchord{D} go
  We've a \upchord{G} flute and a fiddle and a derry down diddle, and a rattle on the ole
  banjo
  \upchord{C} Rolling down, \upchord{G} strolling down to the \upchord{Am} public \upchord{D} house we'll \upchord{G} go
  VERSE 2
  I've \upchord{G} kissed some girls in Belgium, I've cuddled some girls in Spain
  But the \upchord{C} girls I kiss on a \upchord{G} Saturday night are the \upchord{Am} girls I'd kiss \upchord{D}
  again
  When we \upchord{G} cut a caper on the bar room floor for neither lust nor gain
  If \upchord{C} we're not lovers when we're \upchord{G} homeward bound, itâ€™s \upchord{Am} good friends
  \upchord{D} we'll \upchord{G} remain
  >>>Repeat CHORUS<<<
  VERSE 3
  I've \upchord{G} got a dog named Barker, he likes a drop of beer
  He \upchord{C} gets right drunk, rolls \upchord{G} on the floor and he \upchord{Am} grins from ear to \upchord{D}
  ear
  And by \upchord{G} day you'll see us walking over woodland, hill and vale
  \upchord{C} Every night we'll \upchord{G} both get tight on \upchord{Am} Mrs \upchord{D} Sturgen's \upchord{G} ale

  VERSE 4
  Now \upchord{G} some like a cool clear larger, others like a bottle of pale
  The \upchord{C} boys all titter at a \upchord{G} pint of bitter and some \upchord{Am} drink Anstell's \upchord{D}
  ale (God help them!)
  I'm \upchord{G} pegging out for a jet black stout, it's beauty to aspire
  With me \upchord{C} hand the bar I'll \upchord{G} swear Ooo-arr! I'll \upchord{Am} drink it \upchord{D} till I \upchord{G} die
  >>>Repeat CHORUS<<< (slow down at last line to end)
