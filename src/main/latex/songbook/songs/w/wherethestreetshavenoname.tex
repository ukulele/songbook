I wanna \upchord{D} run, I want to hide\\
I wanna tear down the walls that hold me in-\upchord{G}side\\
I wanna reach \upchord{Bm7} out and touch the \upchord{Asus4} flame\\
Where the \upchord{Cadd9} streets have no name\\
I wanna \upchord{D} feel sunlight on my face\\
I see the dustcloud disappear without a \upchord{G} trace\\
I wanna take \upchord{Bm7} shelter from the poison \upchord{Asus4} rain\\
Where the \upchord{Cadd9} streets have no name, ooh-oh\\
Where the streets have no \upchord{D} name\\
Where the streets have no name\\
We're still building and \upchord{G} burning down love\\\
Burning down love and when I \upchord{Bm7} go there\\
I go there with \upchord{Asus4} you, it's all I can \upchord{Cadd9} do\\
The city's a \upchord{D} flood and our love turns to rust\\
We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled \upchord{G} in dust\\
I'll show you a \upchord{Bm7} place high on a \upchord{Asus4} desert plain\\
Where the \upchord{Cadd9} streets have no name, ooh-oh\\
Where the streets have no \upchord{D} name\\
Where the streets have no name\\
We're still building and \upchord{G} burning down love\\
Burning down love and when I \upchord{Bm7} go there\\
I go there with \upchord{Asus4} you\\
It's all I can \upchord{D} do, our love turns to rust\\
We're beaten and \upchord{G} blown by the wind, blown by the wind\\
Oh and \upchord{D} I see love, see our love turn to rust\\
We're beaten and \upchord{G} blown by the wind, blown by the wind\\
Oh when I \upchord{Bm7} go there\\
I go there with \upchord{Asus4} you\\
It's all I \upchord{D} can do\\
