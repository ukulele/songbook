\textbf{Intro}\\
\upchord{A}  \upchord{D}  \upchord{A}  \upchord{D}  \upchord{A}  \upchord{D}\\
\upchord{A}Seven AM, the usual morning \upchord{D}lineup\\
\upchord{A}Start on the chores and sweep 'til the floor's all \upchord{D}clean\\
\upchord{Bb}Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and s\upchord{F}hine up\\
Sweep a\upchord{A}gain, and by \upchord{D}then it's like \upchord{E7}seven fif\upchord{A}teen\\
And so I'll \upchord{D}read a \upchord{G}book\\
Or maybe \upchord{Em}two or \upchord{D}three\\
I'll add a \upchord{Bm}few new \upchord{Em}paintings to my \upchord{G}galle\upchord{D}ry\\
I'll play \upchord{Bm}guitar and \upchord{Em}knit\\
And cook and \upchord{G}ba\upchord{D}sica\upchord{Bm}lly\\
Just wonder \upchord{E7}when will my \upchord{A}life be\upchord{D}gin?\\
\upchord{A}  \upchord{D}  \upchord{A}  \upchord{D}\\
\upchord{A}Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and \upchord{D}baking\\
\upchord{A}Paper mache, a bit of ballet and \upchord{D}chess\\
\upchord{Bb}Pottery and ventriloquy, candle ma\upchord{F}king\\
Then I'll \upchord{A}stretch, maybe \upchord{D}sketch, take a \upchord{E7}climb\\
Sew a \upchord{A}dress!\\
And I'll \upchord{D}re-read the \upchord{G}books\\
If I have \upchord{Em}time to \upchord{D}spare\\
I'll paint the \upchord{Bm}walls some \upchord{Em}more\\
I'm sure there's \upchord{G}room some\upchord{D}where\\
And then I'll \upchord{Bm}brush and \upchord{Em}brush\\
And brush and \upchord{G}brush \upchord{D}my h\upchord{Bm}air\\
Stuck in the \upchord{Em}same place I've \upchord{G}al\upchord{D}ways \upchord{Bm}been\\
\upchord{A}nd I'll keep \upchord{Em}wanderin' and \upchord{D}wanderin'\\
\upchord{A}nd \upchord{G}wanderin' and \upchord{D}wonde\upchord{Bm}rin'\\
\upchord{Em}When will my l\upchord{A}ife be\upchord{D}gin?\\
\textbf{Single strum entire last verse}\\
Tomorrow \upchord{G}night\\
The \upchord{D}lights will ap\upchord{G}pear\\
\upchord{D}Just like they \upchord{G}do on my \upchord{D}birthday \upchord{G}each year\upchord{A}\\
\upchord{Bm}What is it \upchord{E7}like\\
\upchord{A} \upchord{D}\\
Out there where they glow?\\
\upchord{G}Now that I'm \upchord{D}older\\
Mother \upchord{G}might just\\
Let me \upchord{A}go...\\
