\upchord{Am}OK, OK, I \upchord{F}see what's happening \upchord{C}here\\
You're \upchord{G}face to face with greatness, and it's \upchord{Am}strange\\
You don't even \upchord{F}know how you feel\\
It's a\upchord{C}dorable\\
Well, it's \upchord{G}nice to see that humans never \upchord{Am}change\\
Open your \upchord{F}eyes, let's be\upchord{C}gin\\
Yes, it's really \upchord{G}me, it's Maui\\
Breathe it \upchord{Am}in\\
I know it's a \upchord{F}lot\\
The hair, the \upchord{C}bod\\
When you're \upchord{G}staring at a demi-god\\
\upchord{Am}What can I \upchord{F}say except, "You're \upchord{C}welcome"\\
For the \upchord{G}tides, the sun, the \upchord{Am}sky\\
Hey, it's o\upchord{F}kay, it's okay\\
You're \upchord{C}welcome\\
I'm \upchord{G}just an ordinary demi-\upchord{Am}guy\\
Hey, what has two \upchord{F}thumbs and pulled up the \upchord{C}sky\\
When you were waddling \upchord{G}yay high? This guy!\\
\upchord{Am}When the nights got \upchord{F}cold\\
Who stole you \upchord{C}fire from down below?\\
You're \upchord{G}lookin' at him, yo\\
\upchord{Am}Oh, also I \upchord{F}lassoed the \upchord{C}sun (you're welcome!)\\
To \upchord{G}stretch your days and bring you \upchord{Am}fun\\
Also I \upchord{F}harnessed the \upchord{C}breeze (you're welcome!)\\
To \upchord{G}fill your sails and shake your trees\\
\upchord{Am}So what can I \upchord{F}say except you're \upchord{C}welcome\\
For the \upchord{G}islands I pulled from the \upchord{Am}sea\\
There's no need to \upchord{F}pray, it's okay, you're \upchord{C}welcome\\
Ha, I \upchord{G}guess it's just my way of being \upchord{Am}me\\
You're \upchord{F}welcome, you're \upchord{C}welcome\\
\upchord{G}Well, come to think of it \upchord{Am}Kid, honestly I could go on and on\\
\upchord{F}I could explain every natural phenomenon \upchord{C}The tide, the grass, the ground\\
\upchord{G}Oh, that was Maui just messing around \upchord{Am}I killed an eel, I buried its guts\\
\upchord{F}Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts \upchord{C}What's the lesson? What is the take-away?\\
\upchord{G}Don't mess with Maui when he's on a break-away \upchord{Am}And the tapestry here on my skin\\
\upchord{F}Is a map of the victories I win \upchord{C}Look where I've been I make everything happen\\
\upchord{Am}Look at that mean mini-Maui just \upchord{F}tippity-tappin'\\
\upchord{C}(Ha ha ha ha ha \upchord{G} ha, hey)\\
\upchord{Am}Well, any\upchord{F}way let me say, "You're \upchord{C}welcome" (you're welcome)\\
For the \upchord{G}wonderful world you \upchord{Am}know\\
Hey, it's o\upchord{F}kay, it's okay, you're \upchord{C}welcome (you're welcome)\\
Well, \upchord{G}come to think of it, I gotta \upchord{Am}go (hey)\\
Hey, it's your \upchord{F}day to say, "You're \upchord{C}welcome" (you're welcome)\\
'Cause \upchord{G}I'm gonna need that \upchord{Am}boat\\
I'm sailing a\upchord{F}way, away, you're \upchord{C}welcome (you're welcome)\\
'Cause \upchord{G}Maui can do anything but \upchord{Am}float\\
You're \upchord{F}welcome, you're \upchord{C}welcome.\\
You're welcome, and thank you \upchord{C}\\
