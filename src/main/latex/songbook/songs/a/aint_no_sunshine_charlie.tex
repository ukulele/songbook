\section{Ain't No Sunshine / Bill Withers}\label{sec:aint_no_sunshine}
Tip\footnote{(G7 can be substituted for G here. If there are a few of you try playing the 2 chords simultaneously)
(Em can be played with only three fingers, leaving the top string open. This can also help you move
down to G if you barre G)}
