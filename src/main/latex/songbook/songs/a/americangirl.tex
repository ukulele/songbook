\textbf{Verse 1:}

\upchord{C}Well, she was an \upchord{D}American girl

\upchord{F}Raised on \upchord{G}promises

\upchord{C}She couldn't help \upchord{D}thinking that there

Was a \upchord{F}little more to life

\upchord{G}Somewhere else

\upchord{G}After all, it was a \upchord{C}great big world

\upchord{F}With lots of places to \upchord{Dm}run to

\textbf{Chorus:}

\upchord{G}And if she had to die

\upchord{G}Trying, she had one little promise

\upchord{G}She was gonna keep, \upchord{F}oh yeah

\upchord{G}All right, \upchord{C}take it easy, baby

\upchord{Am}Make it last all night, \upchord{F}she was

\upchord{G}An American girl

\textbf{Verse 2:}

\upchord{C}Well, it was kinda \upchord{D}cold that night

\upchord{F}She stood alone on the \upchord{G}balcony

\upchord{C}Yeah, she could hear the \upchord{D}cars roll by

Out on \upchord{F}441 like \upchord{G}waves crashin' on the beach

\upchord{G}And for one desperate \upchord{C}moment there

\upchord{F}He crept back in her \upchord{Dm}memory

\upchord{G}God, it's so painful when \upchord{G}something that's so close

\upchord{G}Is still so \upchord{G}far out of reach

\textbf{Repeat Chorus}
