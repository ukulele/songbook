(Intro)\\
\upchord{G} \upchord{Em} \upchord{D} \upchord{C} \upchord{G}\\
(Verse 1)\\
You are a splendid \upchord{G}butterfly\\
It is your wings that make you \upchord{Em}beautiful\\
And I could make you fly a\upchord{D}way\upchord{C}\\
But I could never make you \upchord{G}stay\\
You said you were in love with \upchord{G}me\\
Both of us know that that's im\upchord{Em}possible\\
And I could make you rue the \upchord{D}day\upchord{C}\\
But I could never make you \upchord{G}stay\\
(Chorus)\\
Not for all the tea in \upchord{D}China \upchord{C}\\
Not if I could sing like a \upchord{G}bird\\
Not for all North Caro\upchord{D}lina \upchord{C}\\
Not for all my little words\\
Not if I could write for \upchord{D}you\upchord{C}\\
The sweetest song you ever \upchord{G}heard\\
It doesn't matter what I'll \upchord{D}do\upchord{C}\\
Not for all my little \upchord{G}words\\
\\
(Instrumental)\\
\upchord{G} \upchord{Em} \upchord{D} \upchord{C} \upchord{G}\\
(Verse 2)\\
Now that you've made me want to \upchord{G}die\\
You tell me that you're unboy\upchord{Em}friendable\\
And I could make you pay in \upchord{D}pain\upchord{C}\\
But I could never make you \upchord{G}stay\\
(Repeat Chorus)
