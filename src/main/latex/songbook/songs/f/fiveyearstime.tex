\upchord{C}   \upchord{F}   \upchord{G}   \upchord{F}      x4\\
Oh, well, in \upchord{C} five years \upchord{F} time\\
we could be \upchord{G} walking round a \upchord{F} zoo\\
With the \upchord{C} sun shining \upchord{F} down over \upchord{G} me and \upchord{F} you\\
And there'll be \upchord{C} love in the \upchord{F} bodies of the \upchord{G} elephants \upchord{F} too\\
I'll put my \upchord{C} hands over \upchord{F} your eyes, but \upchord{G} you'll peep \upchord{F} through\\
And there'll be \upchord{C} sun, sun, \upchord{F} sun \upchord{G} all over our \upchord{F} bodies.\\
And \upchord{C} sun, sun, \upchord{F} sun, \upchord{G} all down our \upchord{F} necks\\
And there'll be \upchord{C} sun, sun, \upchord{F} sun, \upchord{G} all over our \upchord{F} faces\\
And \upchord{C} sun, sun, \upchord{F} sun, \upchord{G} so, what the \upchord{F} heck\\
Cause I'll be \upchord{C} laughing at \upchord{F} all your \upchord{G} silly little \upchord{F} jokes\\
And we'll \upchord{C} be laughing about \upchord{F} how we \upchord{G} use to \upchord{F} smoke\\
All those \upchord{C} stupid little \upchord{F} cigarettes and \upchord{G} drink stupid \upchord{F} wine\\
Cause it's \upchord{C} what we \upchord{F} needed to \upchord{G} have a good \upchord{F} time\\
But it was \upchord{C} fun, fun, \upchord{F} fun, \upchord{G} when we were \upchord{F} drinking.\\
It was \upchord{C} fun, fun, \upchord{F} fun, \upchord{G} when we were \upchord{F} drunk\\
And it was \upchord{C} fun, fun, \upchord{F} fun, \upchord{G} when we were \upchord{F} laughing\\
It was \upchord{C} fun, fun, \upchord{F} fun, \upchord{G} Oh, it was \upchord{F} fun.\\
\upchord{C}    \upchord{F}    \upchord{G}    \upchord{F}      \upchord{C}    \upchord{F}    \upchord{G}    \upchord{F}\\
Oh, well, I \upchord{C} look at you and \upchord{F} say it's the happiest that \upchord{G} I've ever \upchord{F} been\\
And I'll say \upchord{C} I no longer \upchord{F} feel I have to \upchord{G} be James \upchord{F} Dean\\
And she'll say \upchord{C} "Yeah, well I \upchord{F} feel all \upchord{G} pretty happy \upchord{F} too,\\
And I'm \upchord{C} always pretty \upchord{F} happy\\
when I'm just \upchord{G} kicking back with \upchord{F} you\\
And it'll be \upchord{C} love, love, \upchord{F} love, \upchord{G} all through our \upchord{F} bodies.\\
And \upchord{C} love, love, \upchord{F} love, \upchord{G} all through our \upchord{F} minds\\
And it be \upchord{C} love, love, \upchord{F} love, \upchord{G} all over her \upchord{F} face\\
And \upchord{C} love, love, \upchord{F} love, \upchord{G} all over \upchord{F} mine.\\
Although \upchord{C} maybe all these \upchord{F} moments are \upchord{G} just in my \upchord{F} head\\
I'll be \upchord{C} thinking 'bout \upchord{F} them as I'm \upchord{G} lying in \upchord{F} bed\\
And \upchord{C} all that we be-\upchord{F}lieve they might not \upchord{G} even come \upchord{F} true\\
But in my \upchord{C} mind I'm \upchord{F} having a pretty good \upchord{G} time with \upchord{F} you\\
In \upchord{C} five years \upchord{F} time, \upchord{G} I might not \upchord{F} know you\\
In \upchord{C} five years \upchord{F} time, \upchord{G} we might not \upchord{F} speak at all\\
In \upchord{C} five years \upchord{F} time, \upchord{G} we might not \upchord{F} get along\\
In \upchord{C} five years \upchord{F} time, \upchord{G} you might just \upchord{F} prove me \upchord{C} wrong\\
\upchord{C}    \upchord{F}    \upchord{G}    \upchord{F}      \upchord{C}    \upchord{F}    \upchord{G}    \upchord{F}\\
Oh, there'll be \upchord{C} love, love, \upchord{F} love, \upchord{G} wherever \upchord{F} you go  x4\\
Oh, there'll be \upchord{C} love, love, \upchord{F} love, \upchord{G} wherever \upchord{F} you go  x4\\
