\textbf{Verse}\\
\upchord{A} Do you ever feel... \upchord{Bm} like a plastic bag\\
\upchord{F\#m} Drifting through the wind... \upchord{D} wanting to start again\\
\upchord{A} Do you ever feel... \upchord{Bm}feel so paper thin\\
\upchord{F\#m} Like a house of cards... \upchord{D} one blow from caving in\\
\upchord{A} Do you ever feel... \upchord{Bm} already buried deep\\
\upchord{F\#m} Six feet under scream but \upchord{D}no one seems to hear a thing\\
\upchord{A} Do you know that there's... \upchord{Bm}still a chance for you\\
\upchord{F\#m} Cause there's a spark in you\\
\upchord{D} you just gotta\\
\textbf{Chorus}\\
Ig\upchord{A}nite... the \upchord{Bm}light\\
And \upchord{F\#m}let... it \upchord{D}shine\\
Just \upchord{A}own... the \upchord{Bm}night\\
Like the \upchord{F\#m}Fourth of Ju\upchord{D}ly\\
‘Cause baby you're a \upchord{A}fi-i-ire\upchord{Bm}work\\
Come on show 'em \upchord{F\#m}wha-a-at your \upchord{D}worth\\
Make 'em go \upchord{A}"Ah, ah, ah!"\upchord{Bm}\\
As you shoot across the \upchord{F\#m}sky-y-\upchord{D}y\\
Baby you're a \upchord{A}fi-i-ire\upchord{Bm}work\\
Come on let your \upchord{F\#m}co-o-olours \upchord{D}burst\\
Make 'em go \upchord{A}"Ah, ah, ah!"\upchord{Bm}\\
You're gonna leave 'em all in \upchord{F\#m}awe, awe \upchord{D}awe\\
\textbf{Verse}\\
\upchord{A} You don't have to feel... \upchord{Bm}like a waste of space\\
\upchord{F\#m} You're original... \upchord{D} cannot be replaced\\
\upchord{A} If you only knew... \upchord{Bm} what the future holds\\
\upchord{F\#m} After a hurricane... \upchord{D} comes a rainbow\\
\upchord{A} Maybe you're reason why... \upchord{Bm} all the doors are closed\\
\upchord{F\#m} So you can open one that \upchord{D}leads you to the perfect road\\
\upchord{A} Like a lightning bolt...\upchord{Bm}your heart will glow\\
\upchord{F\#m} And when it's time you'll know\upchord{D} you just gotta\\
\textbf{Repeat Chorus}\\
\upchord{F\#m}Boom, boom, boom... even brighter than the \upchord{D}Moon, moon, moon...\\
it's always been inside of \upchord{A}You, you, you...\\
And now it's time to let it \upchord{E}Thro-o-ough\\
‘Cause baby you're a \upchord{A}fi-i-ire\upchord{Bm}work\\
Come on show 'em \upchord{F\#m}wha-a-at your \upchord{D}worth\\
Make 'em go \upchord{A}"Ah, ah, ah!"\upchord{Bm}As you shoot across the \upchord{F\#m}sky-y-\upchord{D}y\\
Baby you're a \upchord{A}fi-i-ire\upchord{Bm}work\\
Come on let your \upchord{F\#m}co-o-olours \upchord{D}burst\\
Make 'em go \upchord{A}"Ah, ah, ah!"\upchord{Bm}\\
You're gonna leave 'em all in \upchord{F\#m}awe, awe \upchord{D}awe\\
\upchord{F\#m}Boom, boom, boom\\
Even brighter than the \upchord{D}moon, moon, moon x 2\\
