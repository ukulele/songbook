\upchord{G} You would not be\upchord{C}lieve your eyes \upchord{F} if ten million fireflies\\
\upchord{G} Lit up the \upchord{C} world as I fell a\upchord{F}sleep\\
\upchord{G} 'Cause they'd fill the \upchord{C} open air \upchord{F} and leave teardrops everywhere\\
You'd \upchord{G} think me rude but \upchord{C} I would just stand and \upchord{F} stare\\
Chorus 1: \\
\upchord{F} I'd like to \upchord{C} make myself be\upchord{Gsus4}lieve\\
That planet \upchord{F} Earth \upchord{C} turns \upchord{Em7} slow\upchord{F}ly\\
It's \upchord{F} hard to say that I'd \upchord{C} rather stay a\upchord{F}wake when \upchord{G} I'm a\upchord{Am}sleep\\
'Cause \upchord{F} everything is \upchord{C} never as it \upchord{D} seems\\
\upchord{G} 'Cause I'd get a \upchord{C} thousand hugs \upchord{F} from ten thousand lightning bugs\\
\upchord{G} As they tried to \upchord{C} teach me how to \upchord{F} dance\\
\upchord{G} A foxtrot a\upchord{C}bove my head \upchord{F} a sock hop beneath my bed\\
A \upchord{G} disco ball is just \upchord{C} hanging by a \upchord{F} thread\\
Chorus 2:\\
\upchord{F} I'd like to \upchord{C} make myself be\upchord{Gsus4}lieve\\
That planet \upchord{F} Earth \upchord{C} turns \upchord{Em7} slow\upchord{F}ly\\
It's \upchord{F} hard to say that I'd \upchord{C} rather stay a\upchord{F}wake when \upchord{G} I'm a\upchord{Am}sleep\\
'Cause \upchord{F} everything is \upchord{C} never as it \upchord{G} seems when I fall a\upchord{F}sleep…..\\
\upchord{G} Leave my door \upchord{C} open just a \upchord{F} crack (please take me away from \upchord{G} here)\\
'Cause I feel like \upchord{C} such an insomnia\upchord{F}ac (please take me away from \upchord{G} here)\\
Why do I \upchord{C} tire of counting \upchord{F} sheep (please take me away from \upchord{G} here)\\
When I'm far too \upchord{C} tired to fall a\upchord{F}sleep\\
\upchord{G} To ten million \upchord{C} fireflies \upchord{F} I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes\\
\upchord{G} I got misty \upchord{C} eyes as they said fare\upchord{F}well\\
\upchord{G} But I'll know where \upchord{C} several are \upchord{F} if my dreams get real bizarre\\
'Cause I \upchord{G} saved a few and I \upchord{C} keep them in a \upchord{F} jar\\
Repeat Chorus 1 ….when I fall a\upchord{F}sleep\\
Repeat Chorus 2\\
\upchord{F} I'd like to \upchord{C} make myself be\upchord{Gsus4}lieve\\
That planet \upchord{F} Earth \upchord{C} turns \upchord{Em7} slow\upchord{F}ly\\
It's \upchord{F} hard to say that I'd \upchord{C} rather stay a\upchord{F}wake when \upchord{G} I'm a\upchord{Am}sleep\\
Be\upchord{F} cause my dreams are \upchord{C} bursting at the \upchord{G} seams…..
