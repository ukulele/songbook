\textbf{intro}
Shake it up \upchord{G}

\textbf{Verse 1}
                    
\upchord{G}I never loved nobody \upchord{C}fully
                      
\upchord{G}Always one foot on the \upchord{C}ground
                          
\upchord{C}And by protecting my heart \upchord{F}truly
                
I got \upchord{Am}lost in the \upchord{G}sounds
                           
I hear in my \upchord{C}mind all these \upchord{F}voices
                          
I hear in my \upchord{Am}mind all these \upchord{G}words
                          
I hear in my \upchord{C}mind all this \upchord{F}music
                 
And it breaks my \upchord{Am}heart, and it breaks my \upchord{G}heart...and it breaks my \upchord{C}h-h-h-h-h-\upchord{G}heart...and it breaks my \upchord{C}h-h-h-h-h-\upchord{G}heart

\textbf{Verse 2}
               
\upchord{G}Suppose I never \upchord{C}met you
                        
\upchord{G}Suppose we never fell in \upchord{C}love
                    
\upchord{C}Suppose I never ever let you \upchord{F}kiss me
              
\upchord{Am}So sweet and so \upchord{G}soft
                   
\upchord{C}Suppose I never ever \upchord{F}saw you
                    
\upchord{Am}Suppose we never ever \upchord{G}called
                        
\upchord{C}Suppose I kept on singing \upchord{F}love songs
                   
Just to \upchord{Am}break my own \upchord{G}fall
                           
Just to break my \upchord{C}fa-a-a-a-a-\upchord{G}all...just to break my \upchord{C}fa-a-a-a-a-\upchord{G}all...just to break my \upchord{C}fa-a-a-a-a-\upchord{G}all...break my \upchord{F}fall...Break my \upchord{G}fall

\textbf{Bridge}

\upchord{Am}All my friends say that of course it's

\upchord{D}gonna get better, gonna get better
                       
\upchord{G}Better, better, better, \upchord{F}better
               
\upchord{G}Better, better, \upchord{C}better

\textbf{Repeat Verse 1}

\textbf{Outro}
                          
And it breaks my \upchord{C}h-h-h-h-h-\upchord{G}heart...and it breaks my \upchord{F}heart...breaks \upchord{G}my heart...and it breaks my \upchord{F}heart...it breaks \upchord{G}my heart
                 
And it breaks my \upchord{F}heart...and it breaks my \upchord{G}heart
