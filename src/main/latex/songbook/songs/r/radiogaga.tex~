  {\small / symbols in chorus denote knocking uke. Loads of percussive opportunities here. Probably best during intro and choruses to have three parts: 1 purely percussive and two different strumming. We’ll sort this out at the meeting.}

  \upchord{F} \upchord{Gm} \upchord{Bb} \upchord{Gm} \upchord{Bb} \upchord{F} \upchord{Bb} \upchord{F} \upchord{Bb}
  \upchord{F}I'd sit alone and watch your light
  My \upchord{Gm}only friend through teenage nights
  And \upchord{Bb}everything I had to know
  I \upchord{Gm}heard it on my \upchord{Bb}ra-\upchord{F}dio
  You \upchord{F}gave them all those old time stars
  Through \upchord{Gm}wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
  You \upchord{Bb}made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
  You \upchord{Gm}made us feel like we c\upchord{Bb}ould \upchord{F}fly (\upchord{Bb}ra - \upchord{F}dio)
  So \upchord{F}don't become some background noise
  A \upchord{Abdim}backdrop for the girls and boys
  Who \upchord{Bb}just don't know or just don't care
  And \upchord{G}just complain when you're not there
  You \upchord{F}had your time, you had the power
  You've \upchord{C}yet to have your finest hour
  \upchord{Bb}Ra – \upchord{F}dio, (\upchord{Bb}ra – \upchord{F}dio)
  CHORUS:
  \upchord{F7}All we hear is \upchord{Bb}radio \upchord{F}ga ga / /
  \upchord{Bb}radio \upchord{F}goo goo / / \upchord{Bb}radio \upchord{F}ga ga / /
  \upchord{F7}All we hear is \upchord{Bb}radio \upchord{F}ga ga / /
  \upchord{Bb}radio \upchord{F}blah blah / /
  \upchord{Eb}Radio what's \upchord{Bb}new\upchord{C}?
  \upchord{Dm}Radio, \upchord{C}someone still loves\upchord{F} you
  We \upchord{F}watch the shows - we watch the stars
  On \upchord{Gm}videos for hours and hours
  We \upchord{Bb}hardly need to use our ears
  How \upchord{Gm}music changes thro\upchord{Bb}ugh the \upchord{F}years
  \upchord{F}Let's hope you never leave old friend
  Like \upchord{Abdim}all good things on you we depend
  So \upchord{Bb}stick around 'cos we might miss you
  When \upchord{G7}we grow tired of all this visual
  You \upchord{F}had your time - you had the power
  You've \upchord{C}yet to have your finest hour
  \upchord{Bb}Ra – \upchord{F}dio, (\upchord{Bb}ra – \upchord{F}dio)
  (REPEAT CHORUS)
