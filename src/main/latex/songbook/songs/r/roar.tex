\upchord{C}I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath\\
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess\\
So \upchord{Am}I sat quietly, agreed politely\\
I \upchord{C}guess that I forgot I had a choice\\
I let you push me past the breaking point\\
\upchord{Am}I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything\\
You \upchord{C}held me down, but I got up (hey)\\
Already brushing off the dust\\
You \upchord{Am}hear my voice, you hear that sound\\
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground\\
\upchord{C}You held me down, but I got up (hey)\\
Get ready 'cause I've had enough\\
I \upchord{Am}see it all, I see it now\\
I got the eye of the \upchord{C}tiger, a fighter\\
Dancing through the fire\\
'Cause \upchord{Am}I am a champion, and  you're gonna hear me \upchord{C}roar\\
Louder, louder than a lion\\
'Cause \upchord{Am}I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me \upchord{C}roar\\
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\\
\upchord{Am}Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\\
You're gonna hear me \upchord{C}roar\\
\upchord{C}Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly\\
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes\\
\upchord{Am}I went from zero, to my own hero\\
\upchord{C}You held me down, but I got up (hey)\\
Already brushing off the dust\\
You \upchord{Am}hear my voice, you hear that sound\\
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground\\
\upchord{C}You held me down, but I got up (hey)\\
Get ready 'cause I've had enough\\
I \upchord{Am}see it all, I see it now\\
I got the eye of the \upchord{Am}tiger, a fighter\\
Dancing through the fire\\
'Cause \upchord{Am}I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me \upchord{C}roar\\
Louder, louder than a lion\\
'Cause \upchord{Am}I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me \upchord{C}roar\\
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\\
\upchord{Am}Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\\
You're gonna hear me \upchord{C}roar\\
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (you'll hear me roar)\\
\upchord{Am}Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\\
You're gonna hear me \upchord{C}roar
