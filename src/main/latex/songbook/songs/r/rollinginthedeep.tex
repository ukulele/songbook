\upchord{Cm} - Palm Muted -\\

VERSE:          \\              
\upchord{Cm}There's a fire \upchord{Gm}starting in my heart,      \\                                          
\upchord{Bb} Reaching a fever \upchord{Gm}pitch and it's \upchord{Bb}bringing me out the dark\\
\upchord{Cm}Finally, I can \upchord{Gm}see you crystal clear.\\
\upchord{Bb}Go ahead and \upchord{Gm}sell me out and I'll \upchord{Bb}lay your ship bare.\\
\upchord{Cm}See how I \upchord{Gm}leave, with every piece of you\\
\upchord{Bb}Don't under\upchord{Gm}estimate the \upchord{Bb}things that I will do.\\
\upchord{Cm}There's a \upchord{Gm}fire starting in my heart,\\
\upchord{Bb}Reaching a fever \upchord{Gm}pitch and it's \upchord{Bb}bringing me out the dark\\
\\
CHORUS:           \\
\upchord{Ab}The scars of \upchord{Bb}your love, remind me of us.        \\           
\upchord{Gm}They keep me \upchord{Ab}thinking that we almost had it all\\
\upchord{Ab}The scars of \upchord{Bb}your love, they leave me breathless\\
\upchord{Gm}I can't help \upchord{G7}feeling...\\
\upchord{Cm}We could have had it \upchord{Bb}all... (I wish you, never had met me)...\\
\upchord{Ab}Rolling in the Deep - Tears are \upchord{Bb}gonna fall, rolling in the deep -\\
\upchord{Cm}You had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your \upchord{Bb}hand (Never had met me)\\
\upchord{Ab}And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the \upchord{Bb}beat (Rolling in the deep)\\
\\
VERSE:     \\
\upchord{Cm}Baby I have no \upchord{Gm}story to be told,\\
\upchord{Bb}But I've heard one of you and I'm \upchord{Gm}gonna make your head \upchord{Bb}burn.\\
\upchord{Cm}Think of me in the \upchord{Gm}depths of your despair.\\
\upchord{Bb}Making a home down there, as \upchord{Gm}mine sure won't be \upchord{Bb}shared.\\
                        \\
REPEAT CHORUS\\
