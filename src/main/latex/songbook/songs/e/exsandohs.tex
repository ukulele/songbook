Now, there's \upchord{Dm} one in Cali-\upchord{A}fornia who's been \upchord{Dm} cursing my \upchord{A} name\\
'Cause \upchord{Dm} I found me a \upchord{A} better lover \upchord{Dm} in the  U\upchord{A}K\\

\upchord{Dm} One, two, three, they gonna run back to me\\
\upchord{Dm} 'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep\\

They \upchord{NC} always wanna come, but they never wanna leave\\

\upchord{A} My, my, how the seasons go \upchord{Dm} by \upchord{A}  \upchord{Dm}   \upchord{A}\\
\upchord{Dm} I get \upchord{A} high, and I \upchord{Dm} love to get \upchord{A} low\\
So the \upchord{Dm} hearts keep \upchord{A} breaking, and the \upchord{Dm} heads just \upchord{A} roll\\
\upchord{A} You know  that's how the story \upchord{Dm} goes \upchord{A} \upchord{Dm} \upchord{A}\\
