\emph{Pick: E8A7,E7A5, E5A3, Gdownstrum, 0230, 0200, Dm up and down lifting index finger off}  \\
\textbf{Intro: Do the pick if you want. If not, C G Dm F} \\
\upchord{C}"Show me how you \upchord{G}do that trick\\
The \upchord{Dm}one that makes me \upchord{F}scream" she said\\
"The \upchord{C}one that makes me \upchord{G}laugh" she said\\
And \upchord{Dm}threw her arms a\upchord{F}round my neck\\
\upchord{C}"Show me how you \upchord{G}do it\\
And I \upchord{Dm}promise you I \upchord{F}promise that\\
I'll run a\upchord{C}way with you \upchord{G}\\
I'll run a\upchord{Dm}way with you"\upchord{F}\\
\textbf{Repeat Intro}\\
\upchord{C}Spinning on that \upchord{G}dizzy edge\\
I \upchord{Dm}kissed her face and \upchord{F}kissed her head\\
And \upchord{C}dreamed of all the \upchord{G}different ways I \upchord{Dm}had\\
To make her \upchord{F}glow\\
\upchord{C}"Why are you so \upchord{G}far away?" she \upchord{Dm}said\\
"Why won't you \upchord{F}ever know that I'm in \upchord{C}love with you\upchord{G}\\
That I'm in \upchord{Dm}love with you"\upchord{F}\\
\upchord{Am}You...\upchord{Bb}Soft and only\\
\upchord{A}You..\upchord{Bb}Lost and lonely\\
\upchord{Am}You...\upchord{Bb}Strange as angels\\
\upchord{F}Dancing in the deepest oceans\\
\upchord{G}Twisting in the water\\
You're just like a \textbf{start intro} dream\\
\upchord{C}Daylight licked me \upchord{G}into shape\\
I \upchord{Dm}must have been a\upchord{F}sleep for days\\
And \upchord{C}moving lips to \upchord{G}breathe her name\\
I \upchord{Dm}opened up my \upchord{F}eyes\\
And \upchord{C}found myself a\upchord{G}lone alone\\
A\upchord{Dm}lone above a \upchord{F}raging sea\\
That \upchord{C}stole the only \upchord{G}girl I loved\\
And \upchord{Dm}drowned her deep in\upchord{F}side of me\\
\upchord{Am}You...\upchord{Bb}Soft and only\\
\upchord{A}You..\upchord{Bb}Lost and lonely\\
\upchord{F}You...\\
\upchord{Bb}Just like \upchord{F}heaven\\
