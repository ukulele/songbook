\textbf{Intro} \upchord{C}  \upchord{Am}  \upchord{F}  \upchord{Am}

\textbf{Verse 1 (See if you can click / clap at the same time - one strum then two clicks)}\\
I got this \upchord{C}feeling inside my \upchord{Am}bones\\
It goes \upchord{F}electric, wavey when I turn it \upchord{Am}on\\
All through my \upchord{C}city, all through my \upchord{Am}home\\
We're flying \upchord{F}up, no ceiling, when we in our \upchord{Am}zone\\
\textbf{Refrain (now to fast strumming)}\\
I got that \upchord{C}sunshine in my pocket\\
Got that good \upchord{Am}soul in my feet\\
I feel that \upchord{F}hot blood in my body when it \upchord{Am}drops\\
I can't \upchord{C}take my eyes up off it, moving \upchord{Am}so phenomenally\\
Room on \upchord{F}lock, the way we rock it, so don't \upchord{Am}stop\\
\textbf{Pre-Chorus}\\
And under the \upchord{Bb}lights when everything \upchord{C}goes\\
Nowhere to \upchord{Bb}hide when I'm getting you \upchord{C}close\\
When we \upchord{Ab}move, well, you already \upchord{Bb}know\\
So just \upchord{Fm7}imagine, just imagine, just \upchord{Ab}imagine\\
\textbf{Chorus}\\
\upchord{C}Nothing I can see but you when you \upchord{Am}dance, dance, dance\\
\upchord{F}A feeling good, good, creeping up on you\\
So just \upchord{Am}dance, dance, dance, come on\\
\upchord{C}All those things I shouldn't do\\
But you \upchord{Am}dance, dance, dance\\
And \upchord{F}ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep \upchord{Am}dancing\\
I can't stop the \upchord{C}feeling\\
So just \upchord{Am}dance, dance, dance\\
I can't stop the \upchord{F}feeling\\
So just \upchord{Am}dance, dance, dance, come on\\
\textbf{Verse 2}\\
\upchord{C}Ooh, it's something \upchord{Am}magical\\
It's in the \upchord{F}air, it's in my blood, it's rushing \upchord{Am}on\\
I don't need no \upchord{C}reason, don't need con\upchord{Am}trol\\
I fly so \upchord{F}high, no ceiling, when I'm in my \upchord{Am}zone\\
\textbf{Repeat Refrain}\\
\textbf{Repeat Pre-Chorus}\\
\textbf{Repeat Chorus}\\
I can't stop the \upchord{C}feeling\\
So just \upchord{Am}dance, dance, dance\\
I can't stop the \upchord{F}feeling\\
So keep \upchord{Am}dancing, come on\\
\textbf{Bridge}\upchord{C} \upchord{Am} \upchord{F} \upchord{Am}\\
I can't stop \upchord{C}the, \upchord{Am}\\
I can't stop \upchord{F}the \upchord{Am}\\
\upchord{N.C.}I can't stop the, I can't stop the\\
I can't stop the feeling\\
\textbf{Repeat Chorus}\\
\textbf{Outro: Sing italics and regular overlapping)\\
Everybody sing\\

\emph{Got this feeling in my \upchord{Am}body}\\
