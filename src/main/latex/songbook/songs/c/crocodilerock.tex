\textbf{intro}

\upchord{G} \upchord{G} | \upchord{Em} \upchord{Em} | \upchord{C} \upchord{C} | \upchord{D} \upchord{D} (x2)

I rem\upchord{G}ember when rock was young

Me and \upchord{Bm}Susie had so much fun

Holding \upchord{C}hands and skimmin' stones

Had an \upchord{D}old gold Chevy and a place of my own

But the \upchord{G}biggest kick I ever got

Was doin' a \upchord{Bm}thing called the Crocodile Rock

While the \upchord{C}other kids were rockin' 'round the clock

We were \upchord{D}hoppin’ and boppin’ to the Crocodile Rock, well

\upchord{Em} Croc Rockin' is something shockin'

When your \upchord{A7}feet just can't keep still

\upchord{D7} I never had me a better time and I \upchord{G}guess I never will

\upchord{E}Oh lawdy mamma, those Friday nights

When \upchord{A7}Susie wore her dresses tight and

The \upchord{D7}Croc Rockin' was ou-out of \upchord{C7}Si-i-ight

\upchord{G} \upchord{G} | \upchord{Em} \upchord{Em} | \upchord{C} \upchord{C} | \upchord{D} \upchord{D} (x2)

But the \upchord{G}years went by and rock just died

\upchord{Bm}Susie went and left us for some foreign guy

\upchord{C}Long nights cryin' by the record machine

\upchord{D}Dreamin' of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

But they'll \upchord{G}never kill the thrills we've got

Burnin' \upchord{Bm}up to the Crocodile Rock

Learning \upchord{C}fast till the weeks went past

We really \upchord{D}thought the Crocodile Rock would last, well

\upchord{Em} Croc Rockin' is something shockin'

When your \upchord{A7}feet just can't keep still

\upchord{D7} I never had me a better time and I \upchord{G}guess I never will

\upchord{E}Oh lawdy mamma, those Friday nights

When \upchord{A7}Susie wore her dresses tight and

\upchord{D7} The-Crocodile-Rockin'-was ou-out of \upchord{C7}si-i-ight

\upchord{G} \upchord{G} \upchord{Em} \upchord{Em} \upchord{C} \upchord{C} \upchord{D} \upchord{D} (x2)
