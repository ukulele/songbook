In \upchord{Dm}every room and every \upchord{G}hall\\
There's \upchord{Am}snow fallin' \upchord{C}over the \upchord{F}city\\
You \upchord{Am}thought that it \upchord{C}would wash a\upchord{F}way\\
\upchord{Am}The bitter \upchord{C}taste of my \upchord{F}fury\\
And \upchord{Dm}all of the messes you \upchord{G}made\\

I'm \upchord{Am}here, I'm \upchord{C}there, I'm \upchord{F}everywhere\\

Verse 2\\
\upchord{Am}Bet you thought \upchord{C}I'd never \upchord{F}do it\\

\upchord{Am}I bet you \upchord{C}figured I'd \upchord{F}pass with the winter\\
