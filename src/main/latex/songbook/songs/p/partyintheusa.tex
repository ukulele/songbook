\textbf{Intro} \\
\upchord{C} \upchord{Em} \upchord{Am} \upchord{G}  x2\\
\textbf{Verse}\\
I \upchord{C}hopped off the plane at \upchord{Em}L.A.X.\\
With a \upchord{Am}dream and my cardi\upchord{G}gan\\
\upchord{C}Welcome to the land of \upchord{Em}fame excess,\\
\upchord{Am}Am I gonna fit \upchord{G}in? \upchord{C}Jumped in the cab,\\
Here I \upchord{Em}am for the first time\upchord{Am}\\
Look to my right and I \upchord{G}see the Hollywood sign\\
\upchord{C}This is all so \upchord{Em}crazy \upchord{Am}Everybody seems so \upchord{G}famous\\
\textbf{Pre-Chorus}\\
\upchord{C}My tummy's turnin' and I'm \upchord{Em}feelin' kinda home sick\upchord{Am}\\
Too much pressure and I'm \upchord{G}nervous,\\
That's when the \upchord{C}taxi man turned on the \upchord{Em}radio\\
And a \upchord{Am}Jay-Z song was \upchord{G}on  \textbf{x3}\\
\textbf{Chorus}\\
So I put my \upchord{C}hands up, they're \upchord{Em}playing my song,\\
And the \upchord{Am}butterflies fly a\upchord{G}way\\
I'm \upchord{C}noddin' my head like \upchord{Em}yeah\\
I'm \upchord{Am}movin' my hips like \upchord{G}yeah\\
I got my \upchord{C}hands up,\\
They're \upchord{Em}playing my song,\\
I \upchord{Am}know I'm gonna be O\upchord{G}K\\
\upchord{C}Yeah\upchord{Em}, it's a \upchord{Am}party in the US\upchord{G}A\\
\upchord{C}Yeah\upchord{Em}, it's a \upchord{Am}party in the US\upchord{G}A\\
\textbf{Verse}\\
\upchord{C}Get to the club in my \upchord{Em}taxi cab \upchord{Am}Everybody's looking at me \upchord{G}now\\
Like \upchord{C}"Who's that chick, that's \upchord{Em}rockin' kicks?\\
\upchord{Am}She gotta be from out of \upchord{G}town"\\
\upchord{C}So hard with my \upchord{Em}girls not around \upchord{Am}me\\
It's definitely not a \upchord{G}Nashville party\\
\upchord{C}'cause all I see are \upchord{Em}stilettos\upchord{Am}\\
I guess I never got the \upchord{G}memo\\
\textbf{Pre-Chorus}\\
\upchord{C}My tummy's turnin' and I'm \upchord{Em}feelin' kinda home sick\upchord{Am}\\
Too much pressure and I'm \upchord{G}nervous,\\
That's when the \upchord{C}D.J. dropped my \upchord{Em}favorite tune\\
and a \upchord{Am}Britney song was \upchord{G}on  \textbf{x3}\\
\textbf{Repeat Chorus}\\
\textbf{Bridge}\\
\upchord{Em}Feel like hoppin' on a \upchord{Am}flight (on a flight)\\
\upchord{Em}Back to my hometown to\upchord{Dm}night (town tonight)\\
\upchord{Em}Something stops me every \upchord{Am}time (every time)\\
\upchord{F}The DJ plays my song and I feel al\upchord{G}right\\
\textbf{Repeat Chorus x 2}\\
