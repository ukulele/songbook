Dm           
If you're blue 
and you don't know 
where to go to, 
Why don't you go

Puttin' on the Ritz.

Dm                   
Different types 
who wear a day coat, 
pants with stripes
And cutaway coat, 
             A7     A7sus     A7
perfect fits,

All dressed up just like an English chappie -- very snappy!

Dm         
Come let's mix where
Rockefellers 
walk with sticks
Or "umber-ellas"
