\textbf{Intro} 
\upchord{C} \upchord{G} \upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{D7} \upchord{G}  \upchord{C} \upchord{G} \upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F} \upchord{G} \upchord{C} \upchord{G}\\
It's \upchord{C}nine o'\upchord{G}clock on a \upchord{F}Satur\upchord{C}day\\
The \upchord{F}regular \upchord{C}crowd shuffles \upchord{D7}in\upchord{G}\\
There's an \upchord{C}old man \upchord{G}sitting \upchord{F}next to \upchord{C}me\\
Making \upchord{F}love to his \upchord{G}tonic and \upchord{C}gin\upchord{G}\\
He says, \upchord{C}"Son, can you \upchord{G}play me a \upchord{F}memory\upchord{C}\\
I'm \upchord{F}not really \upchord{C}sure how it \upchord{D7}goes\upchord{G}\\
But it's \upchord{C}sad and it's \upchord{G}sweet and I knew it comp\upchord{F}lete\upchord{C}\\
When \upchord{F}I wore a \upchord{G}younger man's \upchord{C}clothes."\\
\textbf{Interlude}\\
\upchord{Am}la la la, di \upchord{D7}da da\\
\upchord{Am}La la, di di \upchord{D7}da da \upchord{G}dum\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{G7}\\
\textbf{Chorus}\\
\upchord{C}Sing us a \upchord{G}song, you're the pi\upchord{F}ano man\upchord{C}\\
\upchord{F}Sing us a \upchord{C}song to\upchord{D7}night\upchord{G}\\
Well, we're \upchord{C}all in the \upchord{G}mood for a \upchord{F}melody\upchord{C}\\
And you've \upchord{F}got us all \upchord{G}feeling al\upchord{C}right\upchord{G}\\
Now \upchord{C}John at the \upchord{G}bar is a \upchord{F}friend of \upchord{C}mine\\
He \upchord{F}gets me my \upchord{C}drinks for \upchord{D7}free\upchord{G}\\
And he's \upchord{C}quick with a \upchord{G}joke and he'll \upchord{F}light up your \upchord{C}smoke\\
But there's \upchord{F}some place that \upchord{G}he'd rather \upchord{C}be\upchord{G}\\
He says, \upchord{C}"Bill, I be\upchord{G}lieve this is \upchord{F}killing me."\upchord{C}\\
As the \upchord{F}smile ran a\upchord{C}way from his \upchord{D7}face\upchord{G}\\
"Well I'm \upchord{C}sure that I \upchord{G}could be a \upchord{F}movie star\upchord{C}\\
If \upchord{F}I could get \upchord{G}out of this \upchord{C}place"\\
Now \upchord{C}Paul is a \upchord{G}real estate \upchord{F}novelist\upchord{C}\\
Who \upchord{F}never had \upchord{C}time for a \upchord{D7}wife\upchord{G}\\
And he's \upchord{C}talking with \upchord{G}Davy, who's \upchord{F}still in the \upchord{C}Navy\\
And \upchord{F}probably \upchord{G}will be for \upchord{C}life\upchord{G}\\
And the \upchord{C}waitress is \upchord{G}practicing \upchord{F}politics\upchord{C}\\
As the \upchord{F}businessman \upchord{C}slowly gets \upchord{D7}stoned\upchord{G}\\
Yes, they're \upchord{C}sharing a \upchord{G}drink they \upchord{F}call loneli\upchord{C}ness\\
But it's \upchord{F}better than \upchord{G}drinking a\upchord{C}lone\upchord{G}\\
\textbf{Chorus}\\
It's a \upchord{C}pretty good \upchord{G}crowd for a \upchord{F}Saturday\upchord{C}\\
And the \upchord{F}manager \upchord{C}gives me a \upchord{D7}smile\upchord{G}\\
'Cause he \upchord{C}knows that it's \upchord{G}me they've been \upchord{F}coming to \upchord{C}see\\
To for\upchord{F}get about \upchord{G}life for a \upchord{C}while\upchord{G}\\
And the pi\upchord{C}ano, it \upchord{G}sounds like a \upchord{F}carni\upchord{C}val\\
And the \upchord{F}microphone \upchord{C}smells like a \upchord{D7}beer\upchord{G}\\
And they \upchord{C}sit at the \upchord{G}bar and put \upchord{F}bread in my \upchord{C}jar\\
And say, \upchord{F}"Man, what are \upchord{G}you doing \upchord{C}here?"\upchord{G}\\
\textbf{Interlude}\\
\textbf{Chorus}\\
