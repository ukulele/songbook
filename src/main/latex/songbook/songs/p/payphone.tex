This also works fine with normal C, D and Em chords if it's easier.

\textbf{Intro} \\                      
I'm at a \upchord{Cadd9}payphone trying to \upchord{G}call home          \\          
All of my \upchord{Em7}change I spent on \upchord{Dsus4}you\\
Where have the \upchord{Cadd9}times gone baby\\
It's \upchord{G}all wrong, where are the \upchord{Em7}plans we made for \upchord{Dsus4}two\\
\textbf{Verse}\\
Yeah, \upchord{Cadd9}I, I know it's hard to remember\\
\upchord{G}The people we used to be. \upchord{Em7}It's even harder to picture\\
\upchord{Dsus4}That you're not here next to me. \upchord{Cadd9}You say it's too late to make it\\
\upchord{G}But is it too late to try? \upchord{Em7}And in our time that you wasted\\
\upchord{Dsus4}All of our bridges burned \upchord{Cadd9}down\\
\textbf{Pre-Chorus}\\
I've wasted my \upchord{G}nights You turned out the \upchord{Em7}lights\\
Now I'm para\upchord{Dsus4}lysed Still stuck in that \upchord{Cadd9}time when we called it \upchord{G}love\\
But even the \upchord{Em7}sun sets in para\upchord{Dsus4}dise\\
\textbf{Chorus}\\
I'm at a \upchord{Cadd9}payphone trying to \upchord{G}call home     \\               
All of my \upchord{Em7}change I spent on \upchord{Dsus4}you\\
Where have the \upchord{Cadd9}times gone baby\\
It's \upchord{G}all wrong, where are the \upchord{Em7}plans we made for \upchord{Dsus4}two\\
If happy ever \upchord{Cadd9}after did exist\upchord{G}\\
I would still be \upchord{Em7}holding you like this\upchord{Dsus4}\\
And all those fairy\upchord{Cadd9}tales are full of stick\upchord{G}\\
One more goddamn \upchord{Em7}love song I'll be sick\upchord{Dsus4}\\
\textbf{Verse}\\
\upchord{Cadd9} You turned your back on tomorrow \upchord{G}Cause you forgot yesterday\\
\upchord{Em7}I gave you my love to borrow \upchord{Dsus4}But you just gave it away\\
\upchord{Cadd9}You can't expect me to be fine \upchord{G} I don't expect you to care\\
\upchord{Em7}I know I've said it before \upchord{Dsus4}But all of our Bridges burned \upchord{Cadd9}down\\
\textbf{Repeat Pre-Chorus}\\
\textbf{Repeat Chorus}\\
Now I'm at a \upchord{Cadd9}payphone\\
\textbf{Verse}\\
man slice that cake \upchord{G}I'll be out spending all this money\\
while you're sitting round \upchord{Em7}Wondering why it wasn't you who came \\
up from nothing \upchord{Dsus4}made it from the bottom mow when you see me I'm stunning\\
\upchord{Cadd9}And all of my cars start with a push of a button\\
\upchord{G}Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it\\
\upchord{Em7}Switched the number to my phone So you never could call it\\
\upchord{Dsus4}Don't need my name on my show You can tell it I'm ballin'\\
\upchord{Cadd9}Swish, what a shame could have got picked\\
\upchord{G}Had a really good game but you missed your last \upchord{Em7}shot\\
So you talk about who you see at the top\\
Or \upchord{Dsus4}what you could have saw But sad to say it's over for\\
\upchord{Cadd9}Phantom pulled up valet open doors\\
\upchord{G}Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for \upchord{Em7}Now it's me who they want\\
So you can go take that little \upchord{Dsus4}piece of cake with you\\
\textbf{Repeat Chorus}\\
Now I'm at a \upchord{Cadd9}payphone\\
