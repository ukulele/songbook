\upchord{Bm}TURN AROUND Every now and then I get a \upchord{A}little bit lonely and you're never coming
round.

\upchord{Bm}TURN AROUND Every now and then I get a \upchord{A}little bit tired of listening to the sound of
my tears.

\upchord{D}TURN AROUND Every now and then I get a \upchord{C}little bit nervous that the best of all the
years have gone by.

\upchord{D}TURN AROUND Every now and then I get a \upchord{C}little bit terrified and then I see the look in
your eyes.

\upchord{F}TURN AROUND, \upchord{Bb}BRIGHT EYES Every now and then I fall apart.

\upchord{F}TURN AROUND, \upchord{Bb}BRIGHT EYES Every now and then I fall apart.

\upchord{Bm}TURN AROUND Every now and then I get a \upchord{A}little bit restless and I dream of
something wild.

\upchord{Bm}TURN AROUND Every now and then I get a \upchord{A}little bit helpless and I'm lying like
a child in your arms.

\upchord{D}TURN AROUND Every now and then I get a \upchord{C}little bit angry and I know I've got to
get out and cry.

\upchord{D}TURN AROUND Every now and then I get a \upchord{C}little bit terrified but then I see the
look in your eyes.

\upchord{F}TURN AROUND, \upchord{Bb}BRIGHT EYES Every now and then I fall apart.

\upchord{F}TURN AROUND, \upchord{Bb}BRIGHT EYES Every now and then I fall \upchord{A}apart.

\upchord{A}And I \upchord{F\#m}need you now \upchord{D}tonight and I \upchord{E}need you more than \upchord{A}ever

And if you \upchord{F\#m}only hold me \upchord{D}tight we'll be \upchord{E}holding on for\upchord{A}ever.

And we'll \upchord{F\#m}only be making it \upchord{D}right 'cause we'll \upchord{E}never be wrong.

\upchord{D}Together we can take it to the \upchord{E}end of the line.

Your \upchord{F\#m}love is like a shadow on me \upchord{B}all of the time.

I \upchord{A}don't know what to do and I'm \upchord{E}always in the dark.

We're \upchord{F\#m}living in a powder keg and \upchord{B}giving off sparks.

I really need you \upchord{D}tonight, \upchord{B}forever's gonna start \upchord{D}tonight,

For\upchord{E}ever's gonna start tonight

\upchord{A}Once upon a time I was \upchord{F\#m}falling in love but \upchord{C\#m}now I'm only falling \upchord{D}apart.

There's \upchord{Bm}nothing I can do, a\upchord{E}total eclipse of the heart.

\upchord{A} \upchord{F\#m}\upchord{D} \upchord{E}

\upchord{A}Once upon a time there was \upchord{F\#m}light in my life but \upchord{C\#m}ow there's only love

the \upchord{D}dark.\upchord{A}

\upchord{Bm}Nothing I can say, a \upchord{E}total eclipse of the \upchord{A}heart.
