\emph{On this one, you should play the D chord by fingering an F chord, then adding your 3rd and 4th fingers on the C and E strings 2nd fret to make the annoying D shape. Then you can just lift them off when you need to do the quick Fs in the verse. You mainly play D and G in this - you have to try to make it percussive.}
