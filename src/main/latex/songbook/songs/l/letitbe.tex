When I \upchord{C} find myself in \upchord{G} times of trouble,
\upchord{Am} Mother Mary co\upchord{F}mes to me
\upchord{C} Speaking words of \upchord{G} wisdom, let it \upchord{F} be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}
And \upchord{C} in my hour of \upchord{G} darkness,
She is \upchord{Am} standing right in \upchord{F} front of me
\upchord{C} Speaking words of \upchord{G} wisdom, let it \upchord{F} be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}

Let it \upchord{Am} be, let it \upchord{G} be, let it \upchord{F} be, let it \upchord{C} be
\upchord{C} Whisper words of \upchord{G} wisdom, let it \upchord{F} be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}

And \upchord{C} when the broken \upchord{G} hearted people
\upchord{Am} Living in the \upchord{F} world agree
\upchord{C} There will be an \upchord{G} answerâ€¦ let it \upchord{F} be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}
For \upchord{C} though they may be \upchord{G} parted
There is \upchord{Am} still a chance that \upchord{F} they will see
\upchord{C} There will be an \upchord{G} answer, let it \upchord{F} be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}

Let it \upchord{Am} be, let it \upchord{G} be, let it \upchord{F} be, let it \upchord{C} be
Yeah \upchord{C} there will be an \upchord{G} answer, let it \upchord{F} be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}

Let it \upchord{Am} be, let it \upchord{G} be, let it \upchord{F} be, let it \upchord{C} be
\upchord{C} Whisper words of \upchord{G} wisdom, let it \upchord{F}be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}

And \upchord{C} when the night is \upchord{G} cloudy
There is \upchord{Am} still a light that \upchord{F} shines on me
\upchord{C} Shine until to-\upchord{G}morrow, let it \upchord{F} be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}
I \upchord{C} wake up to the \upchord{G} sound of music
\upchord{Am} Mother Mary \upchord{F} comes to me
\upchord{C} Speaking words of \upchord{G} wisdom, let it \upchord{F} be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}

Let it \upchord{Am} be, let it \upchord{G} be, let it \upchord{F} be, let it \upchord{C} be
\upchord{C} Whisper words of \upchord{G} wisdom, let it \upchord{F}be \upchord{Em}-\upchord{Dm}-\upchord{C}
