On a \upchord{D} warm summer's evenin' on a \upchord{G} train bound for \upchord{D} nowhere,\\
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to \upchord{A} sleep.\\
So \upchord{D} we took turns a starin' out the \upchord{G} window at the \upchord{D} darkness\\
'til \upchord{G} boredom over \upchord{D} took us, and \upchord{A} he began to \upchord{D} speak.\\
He said, \upchord{D} "Son, I've made a life out of \upchord{G} readin' people's \upchord{D} faces,\\
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their \upchord{A} eyes.\\
And if \upchord{D} you don't mind my sayin', I can \upchord{G} see you're out of \upchord{D} aces.\\
For a \upchord{G} taste of your \upchord{D} whiskey I'll \upchord{A} give you some \upchord{D} advice."\\
So I \upchord{D} handed him my bottle\\
and he \upchord{G} drank down my last \upchord{D} swallow.\\
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a \upchord{A} light.\\
And the \upchord{D} night got deathly quiet,\\
and his \upchord{G} face lost all ex\upchord{D}pression.\\
Said, "If you're \upchord{G} gonna play the \upchord{D} game, boy,\\
ya gotta \upchord{A} learn to play it \upchord{D} right.\\
You got to \upchord{D} know when to hold 'em, \upchord{G} know when to \upchord{D} fold 'em,\\
\upchord{G} know when to \upchord{D} walk away and know when to \upchord{A} run.\\
You never \upchord{D} count \upchord{Em} your \upchord{D} money when you're \upchord{G} sittin' at the \upchord{D} table.\\
There'll be \upchord{G} time enough for \upchord{D} countin' \upchord{A} when the dealin's \upchord{D} done.\\
\upchord{D} Ev'ry gambler knows that the \upchord{G} secret to surv\upchord{D}ivin'\\
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to \upchord{A} keep.\\
'Cause \upchord{D} ev'ry hand's a winner and \upchord{G} ev'ry hand's a \upchord{D} loser,\\
and the \upchord{G} best that you can \upchord{D} hope for is to \upchord{A} die in your \upchord{D} sleep."\\
And \upchord{D} when he'd finished speakin', he \upchord{G} turned back towards the \upchord{D} window,\\
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to \upchord{A} sleep.\\
And \upchord{D} somewhere in the darkness the \upchord{G} gambler, he broke \upchord{D} even.\\
But \upchord{G} in his final \upchord{D} words I found an \upchord{A} ace that I could \upchord{D} keep.\\
You got to \upchord{D} know when to hold 'em, \upchord{G} know when to \upchord{D} fold 'em,\\
\upchord{G} know when to \upchord{D} walk away and know when to \upchord{A} run.\\
You never \upchord{D} count \upchord{Em} your \upchord{D} money when you're \upchord{G} sittin' at the \upchord{D} table.\\
There'll be \upchord{G} time enough for \upchord{D} countin' \upchord{A} when the dealin's \upchord{D} done.\\
