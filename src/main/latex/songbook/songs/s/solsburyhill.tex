\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F}\upchord{F} Came in close, I heard a voice\\
\upchord{Dm} \upchord{C} \upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm} Standing stretching every nerve\\

I \upchord{C}did not \upchord{Bbmaj7}be\upchord{Bbmaj7}lieve the infor\upchord{Bbmaj7}mation\\
I \upchord{C}just had to \upchord{Bbmaj7} trust imagi\upchord{Bbmaj7}nation\\
My \upchord{C}heart go\upchord{Bbmaj7}ing \upchord{Bbmaj7} boom boom boom\\
\upchord{Bbmaj7}"Son, " he \upchord{C} said \upchord{Bbmaj7} {Bbmaj7}\\
\upchord{Gm}"Grab your \upchord{F}things,\\

\textbf{Riff}\\
\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F}\upchord{F} To keep in silence I resigned\\
\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F}\upchord{F} My friends would think I was a nut\\
\upchord{Dm} \upchord{C} \upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm} Turning water into wine\\
\upchord{Dm} \upchord{C} \upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm} Open doors would soon be shut\\
\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F}\upchord{F} So I went from day to day\\
\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F}\upchord{F} Tho' my life was in a rut\\
\upchord{Dm} \upchord{C} \upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm} "Till I thought of what I'd say\\
\upchord{Dm} \upchord{C} \upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm} Which connection I should cut\\
I was \upchord{C}feeling \upchord{Bbmaj7}part \upchord{Bbmaj7}of the \upchord{Bbmaj7}scenery\\
I \upchord{C}walked right \upchord{Bbmaj7}out of \upchord{Bbmaj7}the machi\upchord{Bbmaj7}nery\\
My \upchord{C}heart go\upchord{Bbmaj7}ing \upchord{Bbmaj7} boom boom boom\\
\upchord{Bbmaj7}"Hey" he \upchord{C} said  \upchord{Bbmaj7} {Bbmaj7}\\

I've \upchord{Bb}come to \upchord{C}take you home." Back home\\
\textbf{Riff}\\
\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F}\upchord{F} When illusion spin her net\\
\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F}\upchord{F} I'm never where I want to be\\
\upchord{Dm} \upchord{C} \upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm} And liberty she pirouette\\
\upchord{Dm} \upchord{C} \upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm} When I think that I am free\\
\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F}\upchord{F} Watched by empty silhouettes\\
\upchord{F} \upchord{C} \upchord{F}\upchord{F} Who close their eyes but still can see\\
\upchord{Dm} \upchord{C} \upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm} No one taught them etiquette\\
\upchord{Dm} \upchord{C} \upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm} I will show another me\\
To\upchord{C}day I don't \upchord{Bbmaj7}need a \upchord{Bbmaj7}replace\upchord{Bbmaj7}ment\\
I'll \upchord{C}tell them \upchord{Bbmaj7}what the \upchord{Bbmaj7}smile on my \upchord{Bbmaj7}face meant\\
My \upchord{C}heart go\upchord{Bbmaj7}ing \upchord{Bbmaj7} boom boom boom\\
\upchord{Bbmaj7}"Hey" I \upchord{C} said  \upchord{Bbmaj7} {Bbmaj7}\\
"You can \upchord{Gm}keep my \upchord{F}things,\\
