\upchord{G}Long afloat on \upchord{D}shipless oceans

\upchord{C}I did all my \upchord{Em}best to smile

\upchord{G}'Til your singing \upchord{D}eyes and fingers

\upchord{C}Drew me loving \upchord{Em}to your isle

\upchord{G}And you sang, \upchord{F}Sail to me, \upchord{Em}Sail to me, Let me en\upchord{G}fold you                        

\upchord{Em}Here I am, \upchord{D}Here I am, \upchord{C}Waiting to \upchord{Em}hold you

\upchord{G}Did I dream \upchord{D}you dreamed about me?

\upchord{C}Were you hare \upchord{Em}when I was fox

\upchord{G}Now my foolish \upchord{D}boat is leaning 

\upchord{C}Broken lovelorn \upchord{Em}on your rocks,

\upchord{G}For you sing, \upchord{F}"Touch me not, touch me \upchord{Em}not, come back to\upchord{G}morrow

\upchord{Em}O my heart\upchord{D}, O my \upchord{C}heart shies from the \upchord{Em}sorrow" 

\upchord{G}I am puzzled \upchord{D}as the oyster

\upchord{C}I am troubled \upchord{Em}as the tide

\upchord{G}Should I stand a\upchord{D}mid your breakers?

\upchord{C}Or should I lie with \upchord{Em}death my bride?

\upchord{G}Hear me sing, \upchord{F}"Swim to me, Swim to \upchord{Em}me, Let me en\upchord{G}fold you

\upchord{Em}Here I am, \upchord{D}Here I am, \upchord{C}

Waiting to \upchord{Em}hold you"
