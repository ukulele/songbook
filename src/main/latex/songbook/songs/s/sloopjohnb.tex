  \upchord{G} We come on the sloop John B
  
  My grandfather and me
  
  Around Nassau town we did \upchord{D7} roam
  
  Drinking all \upchord{G} night \upchord{G7} got into a \upchord{C} fight \upchord{Am}
  
  Well I \upchord{G} feel so broke up \upchord{D7} I want to go \upchord{G} home
  \textbf{Chorus}
  
  \upchord{G} So hoist up the John B’s sail
  
  See how the mainsail sets
  
  Call for the captain ashore let me go \upchord{D7} home
  
  Let me go \upchord{G} home \upchord{G7}
  
  I wanna go \upchord{C} home yeah \upchord{Am} yeah
  
  Well I \upchord{G} feel so broke up \upchord{D7} I wanna go \upchord{G} home
  
  \upchord{G} The first mate he got drunk
  
  And broke in the captain’s trunk
  
  The constable had to come and take him a\upchord{D7}way
  
  Sheriff John \upchord{G} Stone \upchord{G7}
  
  Why don’t you leave me a\upchord{C}lone yeah \upchord{Am} yeah
  
  Well I \upchord{G} feel so broke up \upchord{D7} I wanna go \upchord{G} home
  
  \textbf{Chorus}
  
  \upchord{G} The poor cook he caught the fits
  
  And threw away all my grits
  
  And then he took and he ate up all of my \upchord{D7} corn
  
  Let me go \upchord{G} home \upchord{G7}
  
  Why don’t they let me go \upchord{C} home \upchord{Am}
  
  This \upchord{G} is the worst trip \upchord{D7} I’ve ever been \upchord{G} on
  
  \textbf{Chorus x 2}
