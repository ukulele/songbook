\upchord{C} All the towers of ivory are \upchord{G} crumbling \\
 And the \upchord{C}swallows have sharpened their \upchord{G} beaks \\
\upchord{C}  This is the \upchord{G}time of our great un\upchord{C}doing \\
This is the \upchord{G} time that I'll come \upchord{C} running \\
 Straight to \upchord{Am}you \\

\upchord{C} The light in our window is \upchord{G} fading \\
 The \upchord{C}candle gutters on the \upchord{G} ledge \\

 For I am \upchord{C}captured \\
 Straight to \upchord{Am}you \\

\upchord{C}  For the \upchord{G}sea will swallow up the \upchord{C} mountains \\
And the \upchord{G} sky will throw thunder-bolts and \upchord{C} sparks \\
 Straight at \upchord{Am}you \\
 But I'll come a-\upchord{C}running \\

\upchord{C} Heaven has denied us it's \upchord{G} kingdom \\
 The \upchord{C}saints are drunk howling at the \upchord{G} moon \\
\upchord{C}  The \upchord{G}chariots of angels are  col\upchord{C}liding \\
Well, I'll \upchord{G} run, babe, but I'll come a-\upchord{C}running \\
 Straight to \upchord{Am}you \\
 For I am \upchord{C}captured \\
 Straight to \upchord{Am}you \\
 For I am \upchord{C}captured \\
\upchord{G} One more \upchord{C} time \\
