\upchord{Em}Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam\\
I was a \upchord{Am}drab little crab once\\
\upchord{Em}Now I know I can be happy as a \upchord{Eb}clam\\
Because I'm beautiful, baby \upchord{Em}\\
Did your granny say listen to your heart\\
Be who you are on the inside\\
I need \upchord{Am}three words to tear her argument a\upchord{Eb}part\\
Your granny lied! I'd rather be \upchord{G}shiny\\
Like a \upchord{C}treasure from a sunken pirate \upchord{G}wreck\\
Scrub the \upchord{C}deck and make it look \upchord{G}shiny\\
I will \upchord{C}sparkle like a wealthy woman's \upchord{Am}neck\\
Just a \upchord{D}sec! Don't you know. //
Fish are \upchord{Em}dumb, dumb, \upchord{C}dumb\\
They chase anything that \upchord{Em}glitters \upchord{C}(beginners!)\\
\upchord{Em}Oh, and here they \upchord{C}come, come, come\\
To the brightest thing that \upchord{Am}glitters\\
Mmm, fish \upchord{D}dinners\\
I just love \upchord{Eb}free food\\
And you look like seafood \\
Well, well, \upchord{Em}well\\
Little Maui's having trouble with his look\\
You little \upchord{Am}hemi-demi-semi-god\\
\upchord{Em}Ouch! What a terrible performance\\
Get the \upchord{Am}hook\\
You don't \upchord{Em}swing it like you used to, man\\
Yet I have to give you credit for my start\\
And your \upchord{Am}tattoos on the out\upchord{Em}side\\
For just like you I made myself a work of \upchord{Eb}art\\
I'll never hide; I can't, I'm too \upchord{G}shiny\\
Watch me \upchord{C}dazzle like a diamond in the \upchord{G}rough\\
Strut my \upchord{C}stuff; my stuff is so \upchord{G}shiny\\
Send your \upchord{C}armies but they'll never be e\upchord{Am}nough\\
My shell's too \upchord{D}tough\\
Maui man, \upchord{Em}you could try, try, \upchord{C}try\\
But you can't expect a \upchord{Em}demi-god\\
To beat a \upchord{C}decapod \\
\upchord{Em}You will die, die, \upchord{C}die\\
Now it's time for me to \upchord{Am}take apart your \upchord{D}aching heart\\
\upchord{Eb}Far from the ones who abandoned you\\
Chasing the love of these humans who made you feel wanted\\
You \upchord{Cm}tried to be \upchord{Dm}tough\\
But your \upchord{Eb}armour's just not \upchord{F}hard enough\\
\upchord{Bb}Maui now it's time to kick your \upchord{Bb7}hiney\\
Ever seen someone so \upchord{G}shiny\\
\upchord{C}Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever \upchord{G}see\\
C'est la \upchord{C}vie mon ami\\
I'm so \upchord{G}shiny\\
Now I'll \upchord{Am}eat you, so prepare your final plea\\
\upchord{D}Just for me\\
\upchord{Eb}You'll never be quite as shiny\\
You wish you were nice and \upchord{G}shiny\\
