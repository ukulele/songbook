Intro: \upchord{D} \upchord{G} \upchord{A} \upchord{D} \upchord{G} \upchord{A}\\
I \upchord{D} sing myself to \upchord{F\#m} sleep… a \upchord{G} song from the \upchord{A} darkest hour\\
\upchord{D} Secrets I can't \upchord{F\#m} keep… in-\upchord{G}side of the \upchord{A} day\\
\upchord{D} Swing from high to \upchord{F\#m}  deep… ex-\upchord{G}tremes… of \upchord{A} sweet and sour\\
\upchord{D} Hope that God ex-\upchord{F\#m}ists… I \upchord{G} hope, I \upchord{A} pray\\
\upchord{D} Drawn by the \upchord{F\#m} undertow… my \upchord{G} life is outta' con-\upchord{A}trol\\
\upchord{D} I believe this \upchord{F\#m} wave will bear my \upchord{G} weight so let it \upchord{A} flow\\
Oh sit \upchord{D} down, oh sit down, oh sit down \upchord{G} sit down next to \upchord{A} me-e\\
Sit \upchord{D} down, down, down, down, down \upchord{G} in sympa-\upchord{A}thy\\

Now \upchord{D} I’m relieved to \upchord{F\#m} hear…\\
that you've \upchord{G} been to some \upchord{A} far out places\\
It's \upchord{D} hard to carry \upchord{F\#m}  on… when you \upchord{G} feel… all a-\upchord{A}lone\\
\upchord{D} Now I've swung back down again, and it's \upchord{G} worse than it was be-\upchord{A}fore\\
If I \upchord{D} hadn't seen such riches, I could \upchord{G} live with being \upchord{A} poor\\
Oh sit \upchord{D} down, oh sit down, oh sit down \upchord{G} sit down next to \upchord{A} me-e\\
Sit \upchord{D} down, down, down, down, down \upchord{G} in sympa-\upchord{A}thy\\
\upchord{D} for 4 bars\\
\upchord{D} Those who feel a breath of sadness… \upchord{G} sit down next to \upchord{A} me\\
\upchord{D} Those who find they're touched by madness… \upchord{G} sit down next to \upchord{A} me\\
\upchord{D} Those who find themselves ridiculous… \upchord{G} sit down next to \upchord{A} me\\
In \upchord{D} love, in fear, in hate, in tears… in \upchord{G} love, in fear, in \upchord{A} hate in tears\\
In \upchord{D} love, in fear, in hate, in tears… in \upchord{G} love, in fear, in \upchord{A} hate in tears\\
