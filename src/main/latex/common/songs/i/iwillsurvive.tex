  \upchord{Am} At first I was afraid I was \upchord{Dm} petrified
  Kept thinkin' \upchord{G7} I could never live without you \upchord{Cmaj7} by my side
  But then I \upchord{Fmaj7} spent so many nights thinkin'
  \upchord{Dm} How you did me wrong
  I grew \upchord{E7sus4} strong I learned \upchord{E7} how to get along
  But now you're \upchord{Am} back
  from outer \upchord{Dm} space
  I just walked \upchord{G7} in to find you here
  With that sad \upchord{Cmaj7} look upon your face
  I should have \upchord{Fmaj7} changed that stupid lock
  I should have \upchord{Dm} made you leave your key
  If I'd've \upchord{E7sus4} known for just one second
  You'd be \upchord{E7} back to bother me
  Chorus:
  Go on now \upchord{Am} go
  walk out the \upchord{Dm} door
  Just turn a\upchord{G7}round now 'cause you're not \upchord{Cmaj7} welcome anymore
  \upchord{Fmaj7} Weren't you the one who tried to \upchord{Dm} hurt me with goodbye
  Did you think Iâ€™d \upchord{E7sus4} crumble did you think I'd \upchord{E7} lay down and die
  Oh no not \upchord{Am} I I will sur\upchord{Dm}vive
  Oh as \upchord{G7} long as I know how to love I \upchord{Cmaj7} know I'll stay alive
  I've got \upchord{Fmaj7} all my life to live and I've got \upchord{Dm} all my love to give
  And I'll sur\upchord{E7sus4}vive I will sur\upchord{E7}vive
  I will sur\upchord{Am}vive \upchord{Dm} \upchord{G7} \upchord{Cmaj7} \upchord{Fmaj7} \upchord{Dm} \upchord{E7sus4} \upchord{E7}
  It took \upchord{Am} all the strength I had not to \upchord{Dm} fall apart
  Though I tried \upchord{G7} hard to mend the pieces of my \upchord{Cmaj7} broken heart
  And I spent \upchord{Fmaj7} oh so many nights just feeling \upchord{Dm} sorry for myself
  I used to \upchord{E7sus4} cry but now I \upchord{E7} hold my head up high
  And you see \upchord{Am} me somebody \upchord{Dm} new
  I'm not that \upchord{G7} chained up little person still in \upchord{Cmaj7} love with you
  And so you \upchord{Fmaj7} felt like droppin' in and just ex\upchord{Dm}pect me to be free
  Now I'm \upchord{E7sus4} savin' all my lovin' for some\upchord{E7}one who's lovin' me
