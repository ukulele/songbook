  They're \upchord{D} Justified, and theyâ€™re \upchord{F#m} Ancient,
  And they \upchord{G} like to roam the \upchord{A} land.
  They're \upchord{D} Justified, and they're \upchord{F#m} Ancient,
  I \upchord{G} hope you under-\upchord{A}-stand.
  They \upchord{G} called me up in \upchord{D} Tennessee
  They said \upchord{G} "Tammy, stand by The \upchord{D} Jams"
  But \upchord{G} if you don't like what they're \upchord{D} going to do,
  You \upchord{A} better not stop them 'cause they're coming through

  They're \upchord{D} Justified, and they're \upchord{F#m} Ancient,
  And they \upchord{G} drive an ice cream \upchord{A} van.
  (just roll it from the top)
  They're \upchord{D} Justified and they're \upchord{F#m} Ancient,
  With \upchord{G} still no master \upchord{A} plan.
  The \upchord{G} last train left an \upchord{D} hour ago,
  They were \upchord{G} singing "All a-\upchord{D}-board"

  \upchord{Bm} Justified and Ancient, Ancient and a-justified,
  Rocking to the rhythm in their ice cream van
  with the plan and the key to
  enter into Mu Mu
  Vibes from the tribes of the Jams
  I know where the beat is at,
  'cos I know what time it is
  Bring home a dime,
  Make mine a "99"
  New style, meanwhile, always on a mission while
  Fishing in the rivers of life
  Fishing in the rivers of life (HOI)
  Fishing in the rivers of life (HOI)
  Fishing in the rivers
  Fishing in the rivers
  Fishing in the rivers of life (HOI)
  Voo-va-voolie
