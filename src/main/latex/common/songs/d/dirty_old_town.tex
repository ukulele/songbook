I met my \upchord{G}love by the gas works wall 

Dreamed a \upchord{C}dream by the old ca\upchord{G}nal 

I kissed my girl by the factory wall

Dirty old \upchord{D}town

Dirty old \upchord{Em7}town\\


Clouds are \upchord{G}drifting across the moon 

Cats are \upchord{C}prowling on their \upchord{G}beat 

Spring's a girl from the streets at night

I heard a \upchord{G}siren from the docks

Saw a \upchord{C}train set the night on \upchord{G}fire 

I smelled the spring on the smoky wind 

Dirty old \upchord{D}town

Dirty old \upchord{Em7}town\\


I'm gonna \upchord{G}make me a big sharp axe 

Shining \upchord{C}steel tempered in the \upchord{G}fire 

I'll chop you down like an old dead tree
