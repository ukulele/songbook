  You can \upchord{F} stay there and I'm sure you will find\\
  Many \upchord{G7} ways to have a good time (1,2,3,4,5..)\\

  \upchord{C} Young man I was once in your shoes\\
  I said \upchord{Am} I was down and out with the blues\\
  I felt \upchord{F} no man cared if I were alive\\
  I felt \upchord{G7} the whole world was so tight\\
  That's when \upchord{C} someone came up to me\\
  And said \upchord{Am} young man take a walk up the street\\
  There's a \upchord{F} place there called the YMCA\\
