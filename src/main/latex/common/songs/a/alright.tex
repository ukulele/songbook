  \upchord{D}We are young, we run green, keep our teeth, nice and clean,\\
  See our \upchord{Em}friends, see the sights, feel \upchord{D}alright,\\
  We wake up, we go out, smoke a fag, put it out,\\
  See our \upchord{Em}friends, see the sights, feel \upchord{D}alright,\\
  \upchord{F\#m}Are we like you? \upchord{F}I can't be sure,\\
  Of the \upchord{Em}scene, as she turns, we are \upchord{A}strange in our worlds\\
  But we are \upchord{D}young, we get by, can't go mad, ain't got time,\\
  Sleep \upchord{Em}around, if we like, but we're \upchord{D}alright.\\
  Got some cash, bought some wheels, took it out, 'cross the fields,\\
  Lost \upchord{Em}control, hit a wall, But we're \upchord{D}alright.\\
