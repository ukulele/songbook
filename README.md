# The Ukulele Songbook Project

## The aims

* to have an open songbook with songs annotated in a relatively straightforward markup.
* to use LaTeX to leverage its typesetting ability.
* have multiple formats of output to cater for a wide range of requirements such as large text or fitting to projector screens.

#### Songbook

LaTeX is an excellent and mature typesetting system which generates PDFs for us, and the songs are all stored in this format, along with various master documents that encompass:

* Archived songs
* New songs
* Special occasion songs
* Single songs

There's plenty of flexibility. The idea was to not have one hefty master songbook, but instead several smaller ones.

LaTeX formatting is not particularly easy, but songs are quite straightforward, and we hope the simple markup is easy to understand.
