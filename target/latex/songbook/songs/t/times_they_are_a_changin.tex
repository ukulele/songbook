Come \upchord{G}gather round \upchord{Em}people \upchord{C}wherever you \upchord{G}roam

And \upchord{G}admit that the \upchord{Em}waters \upchord{C}around you have \upchord{D}grown

And \upchord{G}accept it that \upchord{Em}soon you'll be \upchord{C}drenched to the \upchord{G}bone

If your \upchord{G}time to \upchord{Am}you is worth \upchord{D}savin'

So you \upchord{D}better start \upchord{C}swimming or you'll \upchord{G}sink like a \upchord{D}stone

For the \upchord{G}times, they \upchord{C}are a-\upchord{D}chang-\upchord{G}in'\\


Come \upchord{G}writers and \upchord{Em}critics who \upchord{C}prophesise with your \upchord{G}pen 

And \upchord{G}keep your eyes \upchord{Em}wide the chance \upchord{C}won't come \upchord{D}again

And \upchord{G}don't speak too \upchord{Em}soon for the wheel's \upchord{C}still in \upchord{G}spin

And there's \upchord{G}no tellin' \upchord{Am}who that it's \upchord{D}namin'

For the \upchord{D}loser \upchord{C}now will be \upchord{G}later to \upchord{D}win

For the \upchord{G}times they \upchord{C}are a-\upchord{D}chang\upchord{G}in'\\


Come \upchord{G}mothers and \upchord{Em}fathers \upchord{C}throughout the \upchord{G}land

And \upchord{G}don't criti\upchord{Em}cize what you \upchord{C}don't under \upchord{D}stand

Your \upchord{G}sons and your \upchord{Em}daughters are \upchord{C}beyond your \upchord{G}command

Your \upchord{G}old road is \upchord{Am}rapidly \upchord{D}agin'

Please \upchord{D}get out of the \upchord{C}new one if you \upchord{G}can't lend a \upchord{D}hand

For the \upchord{G}times they \upchord{C}are a- \upchord{D}chan\upchord{G}gin'\\


Come \upchord{G}senators, \upchord{Em}congressmen \upchord{C}please heed the \upchord{G}call

Don't \upchord{G}stand in the \upchord{Em}doorway, don't \upchord{C}block up the \upchord{D}hall

For \upchord{G}he that gets \upchord{Em}hurt will be \upchord{C}he who has \upchord{G}stalled

There's a \upchord{G}battle out \upchord{Am}side and it's \upchord{D}ragin'

It'll \upchord{D}soon shake your \upchord{C}windows and \upchord{G}rattle your \upchord{D}walls

For the \upchord{G}times they \upchord{C}are a- \upchord{D}chang\upchord{G}in'\\


The \upchord{G}line it is \upchord{Em}drawn the \upchord{C}curse it is \upchord{G}cast

The \upchord{G}slow one \upchord{Em}now will \upchord{C}later be \upchord{D}fast

As the \upchord{G}present \upchord{Em}now will \upchord{C}later be \upchord{G}past

The \upchord{G}order is \upchord{Am}rapidly \upchord{D}fadin'

And the \upchord{D}first one \upchord{C}now will \upchord{G}later be \upchord{D}last

For the \upchord{G}times they \upchord{C}are a- \upchord{D}chang\upchord{G}in'
