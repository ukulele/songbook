\upchord{C}Intro:\upchord{Am}\hrulefill\upchord{C}\hrulefill\upchord{Am}

I \upchord{C}heard there was a \upchord{Am}secret chord

that \upchord{C}David played and it \upchord{Am}pleased the lord

but \upchord{F}you don't really \upchord{G}care for music \upchord{C}do you \upchord{G}

Well it \upchord{C}goes like this the \upchord{F}fourth, the \upchord{G}fifth a the \upchord{Am}minor fall and the \upchord{F}major lift | the \upchord{G}baffled king \upchord{E7}composing \upchord{Am}hallelujah

Halle-\upchord{F}lujah, Halle-\upchord{Am}lujah, Halle-\upchord{F}lujah, Hallelu-\upchord{C}\upchord{G}jah \upchord{C}\hrulefill\upchord{Am}\hrulefill\upchord{C}\hrulefill\upchord{Am}\hrulefill

Well your \upchord{C}faith was strong but you \upchord{Am}needed proof

You \upchord{C}saw her bathing \upchord{Am}on the roof

Her \upchord{F}beauty and the \upchord{G}moonlight overthrew \upchord{C}you \upchord{G}

She \upchord{C}tied you to her \upchord{F}kitchen \upchord{G}chair, she \upchord{Am}broke your throne and she \upchord{F}cut your hair | And \upchord{G}from your lips she \upchord{E7}drew the \upchord{Am}hallelujah

\upchord{C}Baby i've been \upchord{Am}here before I've \upchord{C}seen this room and I've \upchord{Am}walked this floor

I \upchord{F}used to live \upchord{G}alone before I \upchord{C}knew you \upchord{G}

I've \upchord{C}seen your flag on the \upchord{F}marble \upchord{G}arch

But \upchord{Am}love is not a \upchord{F}victory march

It's a \upchord{G}cold and it's a \upchord{E7}broken \upchord{Am}hallelujah

Well \upchord{C}there was a time when you \upchord{Am}let me know 

What's \upchord{C}really going \upchord{Am}on below

But \upchord{F}now you never \upchord{G}show that to me \upchord{C}do you \upchord{G}\hrulefill

But \upchord{C}remember when I \upchord{F}moved in \upchord{G}you | And the \upchord{Am}holy dove was \upchord{F}moving too

And \upchord{G}every breath we \upchord{E7}drew was \upchord{Am}hallelujah

Well \upchord{C}maybe there's a \upchord{Am}god above | But \upchord{C}all I've ever \upchord{Am}learned from love

Was \upchord{F}how to shoot \upchord{G}somebody who \upchord{C}outdrew you | \upchord{G}It's \upchord{C}not a cry that you \upchord{F}hear at \upchord{G}night

It's \upchord{Am}not somebody who's \upchord{F}seen the light | It's a \upchord{G}cold and it's a \upchord{E7}broken \upchord{Am}hallelujah

\upchord{F}Hallelujah, \upchord{Am}Hallelujah, \upchord{F}Hallelujah, \upchord{C}Hallel\upchord{G}ujah \upchord{C}\hrulefill
