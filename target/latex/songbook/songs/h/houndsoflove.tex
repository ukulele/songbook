  Chorus:\\
  \upchord{F}When I was a \upchord{C}child:\\
  Running in the \upchord{Bb}night,\\
  Af\upchord{Bb}raid of what might \upchord{F}be\\
  Hiding in the \upchord{C}dark,\\
  Hiding in the \upchord{Bb}street,\\
  And of \upchord{Bb}what was following \upchord{Dm}me...\\
  Verse:
  doo doo \upchord{C}doo doo doo\upchord{Bb}\\
  Now hounds of \upchord{Am}love are haunting \upchord{Dm}me. \\
  oo oo\upchord{Bb} oo oo oo \upchord{Am}\\
  I've always \upchord{C}been a coward\upchord{Dm},\\
  oo oo\upchord{Bb} oo oo oo \upchord{Am}\\
  And I don't \upchord{C}know what's good for me.\upchord{Dm}\\

  And \upchord{Bb}throw them in the lake\upchord{Bb},\\
  And I'll \upchord{F}be\\
  \upchord{F}Two steps on the \upchord{Bb}water.\upchord{Bb}\\
  \upchord{F}I found a \upchord{C}fox\\
  Caught by \upchord{Bb}dogs.\\
  He let me \upchord{Bb}take him in my \upchord{F}hands.\\
  His little \upchord{C}heart,\\
  It beat so \upchord{Bb}fast,\\
  And I'm \upchord{F}ashamed of running \upchord{C}away\\
  From nothing \upchord{Bb}real--\\
  I just can't \upchord{Bb}deal with this,\\
  But \upchord{Dm}I'm still afraid to \upchord{C}be there,\\
  doo doo\upchord{Bb} doo doo doo doo\upchord{Am}\\
  Among your \upchord{Dm}hounds of love,\upchord{Bb}\\

  And feel your \upchord{Dm}arms surrounding \upchord{Bb}me.\\
  ow ow \upchord{Am}ow ow ow ow\upchord{C}\\
